``reconfigure``

``test --all``
   Use to execute |chef pedant|, an integration test suite for the |chef server| installation. By default, only a subset of the available test are run. Add the ``--all`` flag to run the full test suite.
   
``upgrade --all``
   Use for in-place upgrades of the |chef server osc| server, version 11.0.4 (or higher). This subcommand will apply the necessary SQL changes without having to back up data and install the server from scratch. (Data should still be backed up before performing the upgrade, just to ensure that it is available, should it be needed.) This subcommand may only be used when the |chef server osc| server is configured for a standalone topology and it assumes that all services used by |chef server osc| are enabled.
   
   .. warning:: The ``upgrade`` option applies only to upgrading standalone configurations of the |chef server osc| server.
