The ``restart`` subcommand is used to restart all services enabled on the |chef server| or to restart an individual service by specifying the name of that service in the command.

.. warning:: When running the |chef server| in a high availability configuration, restarting all services may trigger failover.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl restart name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand. When a service is successfully restarted the output should be similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ok: run: service_name: (pid 12345) 1s
