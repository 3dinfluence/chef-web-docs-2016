Migrating from using |chef open server| to |chef hosted| can be done in a few simple steps using a cookbook that was designed for this migration. Keep using the same repository or start a new one. Once the |chef hosted| server is ready to go, nodes can be registered with |chef hosted|, bootstrapped (to run the |chef client|), and then be configured and managed by |chef|.
