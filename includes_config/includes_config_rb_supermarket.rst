The |supermarket rb| file contains all of the non-default configuration settings used by the |supermarket|. (The default settings are built-in to the |supermarket| configuration and should only be added to the |supermarket rb| file to apply non-default values.) These configuration settings are processed when the ``supermarket-ctl reconfigure`` command is run, such as immediately after setting up |supermarket| or after making a change to the underlying configuration settings after the server has been deployed. The |supermarket rb| file is a |ruby| file, which means that conditional statements can be used in the configuration file.
