     - |vrrp_instance_interface| Should be set to the name of the dedicated interface for |keepalived|. Default value: ``"eth0"``.
   * - ``keepalived['vrrp_instance_ipaddress']``

     - The ``prempt_delay`` value for the VRRP instance. Default value: ``"30"``.
   * - ``keepalived['vrrp_instance_priority']``
     - |vrrp_instance_priority| By default, all servers have equal priority. The server with the lowest value will have the highest priority. Default value: ``"100"``.

   * - ``keepalived['vrrp_unicast_bind']``
     - |vrrp_unicast_bind| To use multicast, leave this value undefined. This value is configured automatically based on settings in |private chef rb|. |opscode_support| Default value: ``<ip address of cluster IP or eth0>``.
   * - ``keepalived['vrrp_unicast_peer']``
     - |vrrp_unicast_peer| To use multicast, leave this value undefined. This value is configured automatically based on settings in |private chef rb|. |opscode_support| Default value: ``<ip address of peer cluster IP or eth0>``.
