.. warning:: Many optional settings should not be added to the |knife rb| file. The reasons for not adding them can vary. For example, using ``--yes`` as a default in the |knife rb| file will cause |knife| to always assume that "Y" is the response to any prompt, which may lead to undesirable outcomes. Other settings, such as ``--hide-healthy`` (used only with the ``knife status`` subcommand) or ``--bare-directories`` (used only with the ``knife list`` subcommand) probably aren't used often enough (and in the same exact way) to justify adding them to the |knife rb| file. In general, if the optional settings are not listed on `the main knife.rb topic <http://docs.opscode.com/config_rb_knife.html>`_, then add settings only after careful consideration. Do not use optional settings in a production environment until after the setting's performance has been validated in a safe testing environment.

The following list describes all of the optional settings that can be added to the |knife rb| file:
