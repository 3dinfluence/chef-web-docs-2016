On |ubuntu| systems, |apparmor| is enabled in enforcing mode by default. |chef| products do not have a profile available to run under |apparmor|. In order for the |chef| products to run, |apparmor| must set to ``Complaining`` mode or disabled.

To determine if |apparmor| is installed, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo apparmor_status

To install |apparmor|, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo apt-get install apparmor-utils â€”yes

If a response other than ``"0 processes are in enforce mode"`` or ``"0 profiles are in enforce mode."`` is returned, |apparmor| must be set to ``Complaining`` mode or disabled.

To set |apparmor| to ``Complaining`` mode, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/*

Or to disable |apparmor| entirely, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo invoke-rc.d apparmor kill
   $ sudo update-rc.d -f apparmor remove

and then check the status:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo apparmor_status
