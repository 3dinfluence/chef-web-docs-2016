Ensure that the workstation meets all of the software prerequisites and that it has access to a |chef server| and to a machine that can host a node.

The following items are prerequisites for installing the |chef client| on a workstation:

* A computer running |unix|, |linux|, |mac os x| or |windows|; (for installing the |chef client| on |windows|, see :doc:`install_windows`)
* |apple xcode| is installed on machines running |mac os x|; this application can be downloaded from |apple| for free
* A |github| account; the |chef repo| must be downloaded and/or cloned from |github|
* Access to a |chef server|: a hosted |chef server oec| account, a local install of |chef server oec|, or the open source |chef server|
* Access to a machine (physical or virtual) that can be used as the first node; the |fqdn| or IP address for a machine is required by the |subcommand knife bootstrap| command during a bootstrap operation
