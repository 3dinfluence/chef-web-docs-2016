.. note:: The combined configuration places |chef server oec| and |chef analytics| on a single machine for testing purposes. This configuration should not be used in production scenarios.

To set up the |chef analytics| server for a |combined| deployment:

#. Contact |company_name| and get the package that is appropriate for the |chef server| platform and operating system.
#. Enable the |chef server| deployment to publish to |chef actions| by adding the following line to ``/etc/opscode/private-chef.rb``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      dark_launch['actions'] = true

#. Reconfigure the |chef server|:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ private-chef-ctl reconfigure

#. Install the package on the same server that is running |chef server| 11.1.8 or higher. For example on |ubuntu|:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ dpkg -i opscode-analytics_1.0.0-1_amd64.deb

#. Configure the |chef analytics| server by setting the analytics_fqdn in ``/etc/opscode-analytics/opscode-analytics.rb``. This is the |fqdn| for the |chef analytics| web application, and must be different from the ``api_fqdn`` set for |chef server|. For example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      analytics_fqdn "analytics.example.com"

#. Reconfigure the |chef analytics| server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-analytics-ctl reconfigure

#. Verify the installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-analytics-ctl test

#. Use a tool like ``telnet client`` or ``nc`` to verify that TCP/10012 connections can be established from the |chef server| to the |chef analytics| |fqdn|. For example, using ``nc``:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ nc -zv analytics.example.com 10012
      Connection to analytics.example.com 10012 port [tcp/*] succeeded!

#. Troubleshoot issues by checking logs in ``/var/log/opscode-analytics/`` or by running the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo opscode-analytics-ctl tail
