To set up the |push jobs| server for a high availability configuration:

#. Install the package on all servers that are running the |chef server|. For example on |ubuntu|:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ dpkg -i opscode-push-jobs-server_<package>.ubuntu.10.04_amd64.deb

#. Reconfigure the primary backend |push jobs| server:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-push-jobs-server-ctl reconfigure

#. Copy the entire ``/etc/opscode-push-jobs-server`` directory from the backend primary to all frontend and backend servers. For example, from each server run:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ scp -r <Bootstrap server IP>:/etc/opscode-push-jobs-server /etc

   or from the backend primary server:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ scp -r /etc/opscode-push-jobs-server <each servers IP>:/etc

#. TCP protocol ports 10000 and 10003 must be open. These are the heartbeat and command ports respectively. They allow the |push jobs| server to communicate with the |push jobs| clients. In a configuration with both frontend and backend servers, these ports only need to be open on the backend servers. The |push jobs| server waits for connections from the |push jobs| client (and never makes a connection to a |push jobs| client).

#. Reconfigure the remaining |push jobs| servers:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-push-jobs-server-ctl reconfigure

#. Run the following command on each of the backend servers:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ private-chef-ctl reconfigure

   This ensures that the |keepalived| scripts are regenerated so they are aware of |push jobs|.

#. Restart all servers on which |push jobs| will run:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ private-chef-ctl restart opscode-pushy-server

#. Verify the installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-push-jobs-server-ctl test
