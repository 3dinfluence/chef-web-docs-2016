To set up the |push jobs| server for a high availability configuration:

#. Install the package on all machines that are running the |chef server|. For example on |ubuntu|:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ dpkg -i opscode-push-jobs-server_0.0.1+20130307070157.git.98.c04f587-1.ubuntu.10.04_amd64.deb

#. Reconfigure the primary backend |chef server|:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ private-chef-ctl reconfigure

#. Copy the entire ``/etc/opscode-push-jobs-server`` directory from the back end primary machine to all front and back end machines. For example, from each server run:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ scp -r <Bootstrap server IP>:/etc/opscode-push-jobs-server /etc

   or from the back end primary machine:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ scp -r /etc/opscode-push-jobs-server <each servers IP>:/etc

#. TCP protocol ports 10000-10003 must be open. This allows the |push jobs| clients to communicate with the |push jobs| server. In a configuration with both front and back ends, these ports only need to be open on the back end servers. The |push jobs| server waits for connections from the |push jobs| client (and never makes a connection to a |push jobs| client).

#. Reconfigure the remaining |push jobs| servers:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-push-jobs-server-ctl reconfigure

#. Run the following command on each of the back end servers:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ private-chef-ctl reconfigure

   This ensures that the |keepalived| scripts are regenerated so they are aware of |push jobs|.

#. Restart the |push jobs| components:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ private-chef-ctl restart opscode-pushy-server

#. Verify the installation:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ opscode-push-jobs-server-ctl test
