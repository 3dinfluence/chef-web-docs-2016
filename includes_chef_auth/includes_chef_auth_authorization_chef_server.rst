Hosted Chef and Private Chef provide fine-grained control over the actions that Users and API Clients can perform
Unlike Open Source chef, permission to create, update, delete, or view objects (such as nodes) on the Chef Server can be controlled on an object-by-object and user-by-user basis.


	
Hosted and Private Chef provide the flexibility to control a user's access to Chef object in a manner that is commensurate with their role in your organization.

    The permissions available for each type of Chef object and what those permissions imply,
    The method used to determine whether a user is authorized to take a given action, and
    The permissions users will have on newly created objects within your organization.

For a description of how to manage a given user's or API client's permission see Managing Permissions with the Hosted Chef Management Console.
