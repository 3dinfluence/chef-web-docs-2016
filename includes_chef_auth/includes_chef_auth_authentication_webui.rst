The |chef server| user interface uses the |api chef server| to perform most operations. This ensures that authentication requests to the |chef server| are authorized. This authentication process is handled automatically and is not something that users of the hosted |chef server| will need to manage. For the on-premises |chef server|, the authentication keys used by the web interface will need to be maintained by the individual administrators who are responsible for managing the server.
