The \fBupload\fP sub\-command is used to upload roles, cookbooks, environments, and data bags to the Chef server from the current working directory in the Chef repository. This sub\-command is often used in conjunction with \fBknife diff\fP, which can be used to see exactly what changes will be uploaded, and then \fBknife download\fP, which does the opposite of \fBknife upload\fP.
.sp
This sub\-command has the following syntax:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
knife upload [PATTERN...] (options)

This sub\-command has the following options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-n\fP, \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP
Indicates that no action is taken and that results are only printed out.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-purge\fP
Use \fB\-\-purge\fP to delete roles, cookbooks, etc. from the Chef server if their corresponding files do not exist in the chef repository (ED. that ought to be a link). By default, such objects are left alone and NOT purged.  Default: \fB\-\-no\-purge\fP.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-recurse\fP
Use \fB\-\-no\-recurse\fP to disable uploading a directory recursively. Default: \fB\-\-recurse\fP.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-force\fP
Use \fB\-\-force\fP to upload roles, cookbooks, etc. even if the file in the directory is identical (by default, no POST or PUT is performed unless an actual change would be made). Default: \fB\-\-no\-force\fP.
