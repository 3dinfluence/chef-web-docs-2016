The \fBdiff\fP sub\-command is used to compare the differences between files and directories on the Chef server and in the Chef repository. For example, to compare files on the Chef server prior to an uploading or downloading files using the \fBknife download\fP and \fBknife upload\fP sub\-commands, or to ensure that certain files in multiple production environments are the same. This sub\-command is similar to the \fBgit diff\fP command that can be used to diff what is in the Chef repository with what is synced to a github repository.
.sp
This sub\-command has the following syntax:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
knife diff [PATTERN...] (options)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This sub\-command has the following options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-name\-only\fP

.TP
.B \fB\-\-name\-status\fP
Indicates that only the names of files with a status of \fBAdded\fP, \fBDeleted\fP, \fBModified\fP, or \fBType Changed\fP will be shown.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-recurse\fP

\fBExamples\fP
.sp

.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ knife diff
.ft P

.sp

.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ knife diff \-\-name\-status node\-lb
.ft P
.fi
.sp
to return something like:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
node\-lb/recipes/eip.rb
node\-lb/recipes/heartbeat\-int.rb
node\-lb/templates/default/corpsite.conf.erb
node\-lb/files/default/wildcard.node.com.crt
