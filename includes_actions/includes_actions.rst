|chef actions| is an add-on for |chef server oec| that provides visibility into what is happening on the server. The |chef server oec| server gathers a lot of data---each node objects, the node run history for all nodes, the history of every cookbook and cookbook version, how policy settings---such as roles, environments, and data bags---are applied and to what they are applied, individual user data, and so on.
