=====================================================

A node is any physical, virtual, or cloud machine that is configured to be maintained by a |chef client|. There are two ways to install the |chef client| on a node so that it may be maintained by the |chef client|:

* Use the |subcommand knife bootstrap| subcommand to `bootstrap a node using the omnibus installer <http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_nodes_bootstrap.html>`_
* Use an unattended install to bootstrap a node from itself, without using |ssh|
