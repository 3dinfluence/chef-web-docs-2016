In the event that Customer believes there is cause to increase the |opscode| defined severity level for a specific incident, or if |opscode| does not maintain communication status to Customer consistent with the commitments made in Incident Severity, Customer can request that the incident be escalated to the next level.

All escalation requests should be initiated through the |chef private| Support representative, and not to any other |opscode| personnel directly.  Customer requested escalations will be undertaken by |chef private| Support, and will occur through the Incident Severity Escalation Table.

Only in the event that Customer has not received a response that the desired escalation has occurred within thirty (30) minutes of Customerâ€™s request, should the next |opscode| escalation level be contacted directly. Customer should verify that escalation has not occurred, or that it remains in consideration, with the |chef private| Support representative prior to utilizing the |chef private| Support Escalation Contacts in Appendix B for their direct escalation.
