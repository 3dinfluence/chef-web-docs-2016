|windows powershell_dsc| is a feature of |windows powershell| that provides `a set of language extensions, cmdlets, and resources <http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn249912.aspx>`_ that can be used to declaratively configure software. |windows powershell_dsc_short| is similar to |chef|, in that both tools are idempotent, take similar approaches to the concept of resources, describe the configuration of a system, and then take the steps required to do that configuration. The most important difference between |chef| and |windows powershell_dsc_short| is that |chef| uses |ruby| and |windows powershell_dsc_short| is exposed as configuration data from within |windows powershell|.
