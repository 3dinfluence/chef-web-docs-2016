The basic syntax of a notification is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   notifies ( [ {resources("execute[something]") => [:notification, :timer] } ] )

and to specify multiple notifications in a single call:

.. code-block:: ruby

   notifies ( [ {resources("execute[something]") => [:notification, :timer]},
   {resources("execute[something]") => [:notification, :timer]},
   {resources("execute[something]") => [:notification, :timer]} ] )
