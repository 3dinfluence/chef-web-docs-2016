Use ``set`` to specify an attribute that exists in the |json| object, and then get its value.

The syntax for this function:

.. code-block:: java

   set($variableToSet, valueToSet)

where:

* ``variableToSet`` is an attribute in the |json| oject
* ``valueToSet`` is the value for that attribute

For example:

.. code-block:: java

   set(organization_name = "ponyville")
