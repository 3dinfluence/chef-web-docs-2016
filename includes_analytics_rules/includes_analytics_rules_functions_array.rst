Use ``array:contains`` to look for an attribute in the |json| object, and then determine its value.

The syntax for this function:

.. code-block:: java

   array:contains(field, valueToFind)

where:

* ``field`` is an attribute in the |json| oject
* ``valueToFind`` is the value for that attribute

For example:

.. code-block:: java

   array:contains(organization_name = "ponyville")
