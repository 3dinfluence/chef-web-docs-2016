Use ``get()`` to identify a field, and then identify an associated value.

The syntax for this function:

.. code-block:: java

   get(variableToGet, valueToSet OR defaultIfMissing)

where:

* ``variableToGet`` specifies the field to look for
* ``valueToSet`` specifies the value to use
* ``defaultIfMissing`` specifies to use the default value if there is no user-defined value
