Use ``notify()`` to configure notifications for a rule. Notifications may be sent using HTTP, SMTP, or |hipchat|.

The syntax for this function:

.. code-block:: ruby

   notify(notificationAlias, stringTemplate)

where:

* ``notificationAlias`` is the alias to which the notification is sent
* ``stringTemplate`` is an optional |mustache| template that defines the notification

For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   rules "Send notification"
     rule on action
       when
         organization_name = "ponyville" and
         (entity_type = "foo" or entity_type = "bar") and
         remote_hostname =~ "33\.3[0-9].*"
       then
         set value #foo = "100"
         set value #xyz = "test"
         notify(hipchat "Hipchat notification <obj.requestor_name> did something at <obj.recorded_at>!")
     end
   end
