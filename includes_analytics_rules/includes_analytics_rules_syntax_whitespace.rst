Whitespace is ignored by the rules parser unless it is contained within single- or double-quotes. For example, the following rules are parsed the same way:

.. code-block:: ruby

   rules "rule"
     rule on action
     when
       true
     then
       audit:info("string")
     end
   end

and:

.. code-block:: ruby

   rules "rule" rule on action when true then audit:info("string") end end

The rules parser does not ignore spaces that are contained within single- or double-quotes. For example

.. code-block:: ruby

   'This is a string. The parser will not ignore the whitespace.'

or:

.. code-block:: ruby

   "This is a string. The parser will not ignore the whitespace."
