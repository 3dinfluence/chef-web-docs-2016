.. The contents of this file are included in multiple topics and describes a property/attribute of a resource, a configuration setting, or an option in a command-line tool.
.. This file is very likely included in many spots across doc sets and versioned docs sets. It should be edited carefully, keeping in mind that it must be a neutral, matter-of-fact statement that does not include default values, version- or application-specific context (which should be on the page about that version or application, instead).
.. This file should not be changed in a way that hinders its ability to appear in multiple documentation sets.

Use to specify that search results are returned only when a user has read access to the search result, as determined by ACL settings. When true, the |chef manage| user interface will perform faster because redundant ACL checks are skipped. Run ``chef-manage-ctl reconfigure`` in addition to ``chef-server-ctl reconfigure`` to ensure a change to this setting is applied to the |chef manage|. Default value: ``false``.

.. warning:: When ``true``, ``opscode_erchef['strict_search_result_acls']`` affects all search results and any user that does not have read access to the search result will not be able to view it.
