Use to specify that search results only return objects that an actor (user, client, etc) has read access to, as determined by ACL settings. This affects all searches. When true, the |chef manage| user interface can see a speed increase from this setting, as it enables |chef-manage| to skip redundant ACL checks. To ensure |chef-manage| is configured properly, after this setting has been applied with a ``chef-server-ctl reconfigure' run ``chef-manage-ctl reconfigure`` to ensure |chef-manage| picks up the setting. Default value: ``false``.

.. warning:: When ``true``, ``opscode_erchef['strict_search_result_acls']`` affects all search results and any actor (user, client, etc) that does not have read access to a search result will not be able to view it. For example, this could affect search results returned during chef client runs if a client does not have the needed read ACL.
