 .. revealjs:: Objectives

    * Understand why we abstract data from policy
    * Policy defines the desired state of the system, whereas data defines the details that might change
    * Understand which resources to use to apply policy and manage data

	For example:

    * Apache Tomcat should be installed (policy); version 6 (data)
    * A file should exit (policy); the contents of that file (data)
