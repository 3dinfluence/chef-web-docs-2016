The ``attribute`` method is used to define a list of attributes and any of those attribute's associated validation parameters. The syntax for the ``attribute`` method is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   attribute :attribute_name :validation_parameter => value, :validation_parameter => value

where ``attribute`` must have an attribute name and zero (or more) validation parameters.
