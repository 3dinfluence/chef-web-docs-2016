Each policy group and individual policy are separate objects for the purposes of authentication. This enables each policy and policy group to have restricted access, such as for specific nodes that handle sensitive data or for specific production groups that require sign-off as part of organizational requirements.

A requestor must have permission to both the policy and the policy group in order for any action to be authorized.
