Opscode does not require that contributors sign a
contributor license agreement (CLA) in order to contribute
to the documentation.

If you would like to contribute, please do one of the following:

1) For simple changes, please use pull requests.

2) Use branches for more complex changes, longer topics, and so on. In general, if the changes are within a single topic, using a pull request is just fine.

3) Please remember that topics found in folders with naming
   patterns like includes_ or swaps_ are built into many
   locations, so changes to these files may affect many
   build paths.

4) For very large changes, please consider using JIRA and the
   same process that you have used with Cookbooks.

Opscode will handle the version updates during the release process.
You are welcome to correct typos or otherwise make updates to 
documentation in the README.
