Use the |resource batch| resource to execute a batch script using the |windows cmd exe| interpreter. The |resource batch| resource creates and executes a temporary file (similar to how the |resource script| resource behaves), rather than running the command inline. This resource inherits actions (``:run`` and ``:nothing``) and attributes (``creates``, ``cwd``, ``environment``, ``group``, ``path``, ``timeout``, and ``user``) from the |resource execute| resource. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` to guard this resource for idempotence.
