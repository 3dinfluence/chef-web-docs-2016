Using the |resource dsc_resource| has the following requirements:

* |windows management_framework| 5.0 February Preview (or higher), which includes |windows powershell| 5.0.10018.0
* The ``RefreshMode`` configuration setting in the Local Configuration Manager must be set to ``Disabled``.

  **NOTE:** Starting with the |chef client| 12.6 release, this requirement applies only for versions of |windows powershell| earlier than 5.0.10586.0. The latest version of |windows management_framework| 5 has relaxed the limitation that prevented the |chef client| from running in non-disabled refresh mode.

* The |resource dsc_script| resource  may not be used in the same run-list with the |resource dsc_resource|. This is because the |resource dsc_script| resource requires that ``RefreshMode`` in the Local Configuration Manager be set to ``Push``, whereas the |resource dsc_resource| resource requires it to be set to ``Disabled``.

  **NOTE:** Starting with the |chef client| 12.6 release, this requirement applies only for versions of |windows powershell| earlier than 5.0.10586.0. The latest version of |windows management_framework| 5 has relaxed the limitation that prevented the |chef client| from running in non-disabled refresh mode, which allows the Local Configuration Manager to be set to ``Push``.
