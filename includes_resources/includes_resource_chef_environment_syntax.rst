The syntax for using the |resource chef_environment| resource in a recipe is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   chef_environment "name" do
     attribute "value" # see attributes section below
     ...
     action :action # see actions section below
   end

where 

* ``chef_environment`` tells the |chef client| to use the ``Chef::Provider::ChefEnvironment`` provider during the |chef client| run
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block; when the ``name`` attribute is not specified as part of a recipe, ``name`` is also the name of the environment
* ``attribute`` is zero (or more) of the attributes that are available for this resource
* ``:action`` identifies which steps the |chef client| will take to bring the node into the desired state
