Use the |resource log| resource to to create log entries. The |resource log| resource behaves like any other resource: built into the resource collection during the compile phase, and then run during the execution phase. (To create a log entry that is not built into the resource collection, use ``Chef::Log`` instead of the |resource log| resource.)
