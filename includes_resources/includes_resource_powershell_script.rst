Use the |resource powershell_script| resource to execute a script using the |windows powershell| interpreter, much like how the |resource script| and |resource script|-based resources---|resource script_bash|, |resource script_csh|, |resource script_perl|, |resource script_python|, and |resource script_ruby|---are used. The |resource powershell_script| is specific to the |windows| platform and the |windows powershell| interpreter.

The |resource powershell_script| resource creates and executes a temporary file (similar to how the |resource script| resource behaves), rather than running the command inline. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` to guard this resource for idempotence.
