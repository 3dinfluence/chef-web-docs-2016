Use the |resource powershell_script| resource to execute a script using the |windows powershell| interpreter, much like how the |resource script| and |resource script|-based resources---|resource script_bash|, |resource script_csh|, |resource script_perl|, |resource script_python|, and |resource script_ruby|---are used. The |resource powershell_script| is specific to the |windows| platform and the |windows powershell| interpreter. This resource creates and executes a temporary file (similar to how the |resource script| resource behaves), rather than running the command inline. This resource includes actions (``:run`` and ``:nothing``; ) and attributes (``creates``, ``cwd``, ``environment``, ``group``, ``path``, ``timeout``, and ``user``) that are inherited from the |resource execute| resource. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use the ``not_if`` and ``only_if`` meta parameters to guard the use of this resource for idempotence.
