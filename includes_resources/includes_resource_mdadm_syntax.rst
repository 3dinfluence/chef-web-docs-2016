The syntax for using the |resource mdadm| resource in a recipe is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   mdadm "name" do
     attribute "value" # see attributes section below
     ...
     action :action # see actions section below
   end

where 

* ``mdadm`` tells the |chef client| to use the ``Chef::Provider::Mdadm`` provider during the |chef client| run
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block; when the ``raid_device`` attribute is not specified as part of a recipe, ``name`` is also the name of the |raid| device
* ``attribute`` is zero (or more) of the attributes that are available for this resource
* ``:action`` identifies which steps the |chef client| will take to bring the node into the desired state
