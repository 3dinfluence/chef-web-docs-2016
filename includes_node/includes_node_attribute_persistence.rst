At the beginning of a |chef| run, all default, override, and automatic attributes are reset. |chef| rebuilds them using data collected by |ohai| at the beginning of the |chef| run and by attributes that are defined in cookbooks, roles, and environments. Normal attributes are never reset. All attributes are then merged and applied to the node according to attribute precedence. At the conclusion of the |chef| run, all default, override, and automatic attributes disappear, leaving only a collection of normal attributes that will persist until the next |chef| run.
