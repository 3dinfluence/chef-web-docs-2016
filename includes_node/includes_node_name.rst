The name of a node is required as part of the authentication process to the |chef server|. The name of each node must be unique within an organization, but otherwise can be any string that matches the following regular expression::

   /^[\-[:alnum:]_:.]+$/

The name of a node can be obtained from the ``node_name`` attribute in the |client rb| file or by allowing |ohai| to collect this data during the |chef client| run. When |ohai| collects this data during the |chef client| run, it uses the |fqdn| name of the node (which is always unique within an organization) as the name of the node. 

Using the |fqdn| as the node name, and then allowing |ohai| to collect this information during each |chef client| run, is the recommended approach and the easiest way to ensure that the names of all nodes across the organization are unique.
