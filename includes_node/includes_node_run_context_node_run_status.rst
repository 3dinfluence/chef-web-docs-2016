.. The contents of this file are included in multiple topics.
.. This file should not be changed in a way that hinders its ability to appear in multiple documentation sets. 


.. notes for future documentation: Use ``node.run_status`` to view the current status of a |chef client| run. As resources are converged, they are added to the run status object. ``run_status`` is an empty |ruby hash| that stores the current status of the |chef client| run.

.. notes for future documentation: ``run_status`` has two available methods: ``success?`` and ``failed?``.
