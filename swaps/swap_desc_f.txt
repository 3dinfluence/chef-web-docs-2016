.. |fatal_windows_admin_check| replace:: Indicates that a |chef client| run should fail if the |chef client| does not have administrator privileges in |windows|.

.. |failovermethod| replace:: The fail-over method. ``roundrobin`` randomly selects a URL out of a list of URLs and proceeds through each of them as it encounters a failure when contacting the host; ``priority`` starts from the first base URL listed and proceeds through them sequentially. Default value: ``roundrobin``.



.. |file| replace:: The name of the cookbook file to be downloaded.

.. |file atomic_update| replace:: Indicates whether atomic file updates are used for all resources. Set to ``true`` for global atomic file updates. Set to ``false`` for global non-atomic file updates. (Use the ``atomic_update`` setting on a per-resource basis to override this setting.) Default value: ``false``.

.. |file backup_path| replace:: The location in which backup files are stored. If this value is empty, backup files will be stored in the directory of the target file. Default value: ``/var/chef/backup``.

.. |file cache_path| replace:: The location in which cookbooks (and other transient data) files are stored when they are synchronized. (This value can also be used in recipes to download files with the ``remote_file`` resource.)

.. |file local_settings| replace:: The name of the local settings file to be generated by a template.


.. |file private_key| replace:: Indicates that the private key will be saved to a specified file name.
.. |file public_key| replace:: All users are assigned a public key. Use to write the public key to a file.
.. |FILE_NAME| replace:: The name of a file that is associated with a cookbook.

.. |file pear_channel| replace:: The definition file for a |pear| channel.

.. |files_backup| replace:: The number of backup copies to keep for files in the directory.

.. |finish_script| replace:: Indicates whether a service has a finish script. 

.. |firewall enable_bluelock| replace:: Indicates whether to install a firewall with which public network access can be controlled.
.. |firewall rule_incoming| replace:: The IP address or subnet from which incoming traffic originates.

.. |flags| replace:: One (or more) command line flags that are passed to the interpreter when a command is invoked.

.. |flat| replace:: Indicates that a list of file names will be shown. Set to ``false`` to view ls-like output.

.. |flavor| replace:: The name of the flavor that identifies the hardware configuration of the server, including disk space, memory capacity, and CPU priority.

.. |flush_cache| replace:: An array that indicates whether the |yum| cache should be flushed before or after a |yum| operation that installs, upgrades, or removes a package. Possible values: ``:before`` and ``:after``.

.. |force| replace:: Indicates that the download of a deprecated cookbook will be forced.
.. |force directory| replace:: Indicates that an existing directory will be overwritten.
.. |force knife download| replace:: Use ``--force`` to download files even when the file on the hard drive is identical to the object on the server (role, cookbook, etc.).  By default, files are compared to see if they have equivalent content, and local files are only overwritten if they are different.
.. |force knife upload| replace:: Use ``--force`` to upload roles, cookbooks, etc. even if the file in the directory is identical (by default, no ``POST`` or ``PUT`` is performed unless an actual change would be made).
.. |force update| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook should be updated even if the ``--freeze`` flag has been set.

.. |force_formatter| replace:: Indicates that formatter output will be used instead of logger output.
.. |force_logger| replace:: Indicates that logger output will be used instead of formatter output.

.. |force_unlink| replace:: Use to specify how the |chef client| handles certain situations when the target file turns out not to be a file. For example, when a target file is actually a symlink. Set to ``true`` to have the |chef client| delete the non-file target and replace it with the specified file. Set to ``false`` for the |chef client| to raise an error.


.. |format| replace:: The output format: ``summary`` (default), ``text``, ``json``, ``yaml``, and ``pp``.

.. |fork_chef| replace:: Indicates that a |chef client| run will be contained in a secondary process with dedicated RAM. When the |chef client| run is complete the RAM will be returned to the master process. This option helps ensure that a |chef client| will use a steady amount of RAM over time because the master process will not run recipes. This option will also help prevent memory leaks (such as those that can be introduced by the code contained within a poorly designed cookbook).

.. |freeze| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook cannot be modified; any changes to this cookbook must be included as a new version. Only the ``--force`` option can override this setting.

.. |fstype| replace:: The file system type (fstype) of the device.

.. |ftp_active_mode| replace:: Indicates whether the |chef client| will use active or passive FTP. Set to ``true`` to use active FTP.
