.. |fatal_windows_admin_check| replace:: Indicates that a |chef| run should fail if the |chef client| does not have administrator privileges in |windows|.

.. |failovermethod| replace:: The fail-over method. ``roundrobin`` randomly selects a URL out of a list of URLs and proceeds through each of them as it encounters a failure when contacting the host; ``priority`` starts from the first base URL listed and proceeds through them sequentially. Default value: ``roundrobin``.

.. |feature_name lwrp windows_feature| replace:: The name of a server role, role service, or feature. Depending on the provider being used, the same feature may have different names. For example: ``DHCPServer`` vs. ``DHCP``; ``DNS-Server-Full-Role`` vs. ``DNS``.

.. |file| replace:: The name of the cookbook file to be downloaded.
.. |file_backup_path| replace:: The location in which backup files are stored. If this value is empty, backup files will be stored in the directory of the target file. Default value: ``/var/chef/backup``.

.. |file_cache_path| replace:: The location in which cookbooks (and other transient data) files are stored when they are synchronized with |chef|. (This value can also be used in recipes to download files with the ``remote_file`` resource.) 
.. |file private key| replace:: Indicates that the private key will be saved to a specified file name.
.. |file_public_key| replace:: All users are assigned a public key. Use to write the public key to a file.
.. |FILE_NAME| replace:: The name of a file that is associated with a cookbook.
.. |files_backup resource remote_directory| replace:: The number of backup copies to keep for files in the directory. Default value: ``5``.

.. |finish lwrp daemontools_service| replace:: Indicates whether a service has a finish script. Default value: ``nil``.

.. |flags| replace:: One (or more) command line flags that are passed to the interpreter when a command is invoked.

.. |flavor| replace:: The name of the flavor that identifies the hardware configuration of the server, including disk space, memory capacity, and CPU priority.
.. |flush_cache resource package| replace:: An attribute for the ``yum_package`` provider that is used to flush the internal YumCache before or after an install or upgrade action. Default value: ``{ :before => false, :after => false }``.
.. |flush_cache resource yum| replace:: An array that indicates whether the |yum| cache should be flushed before or after a |yum| operation that installs, upgrades, or removes a package. Default value: ``nil``. Possible values: ``:before`` and ``:after``. This attribute is only available for the ``yum_package`` resource.

.. |force| replace:: Indicates that the download of a deprecated cookbook will be forced.
.. |force directory| replace:: Indicates that an existing directory will be overwritten.
.. |force knife download| replace:: Use ``--force`` to download files even when the file on the hard drive is identical to the object on the server (role, cookbook, etc.).  By default, files are compared to see if they have equivalent content, and local files are only overwritten if they are different.  Default: ``--no-force``.
.. |force knife upload| replace:: Use ``--force`` to upload roles, cookbooks, etc. even if the file in the directory is identical (by default, no POST or PUT is performed unless an actual change would be made). Default: ``--no-force``.
.. |force update| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook should be updated even if the ``--freeze`` flag has been set.

.. |force_formatter| replace:: Indicates that formatter output will be used instead of logger output.
.. |force_logger| replace:: Indicates that logger output will be used instead of formatter output.

.. |format| replace:: The output format: ``summary`` (default), ``text``, ``json``, ``yaml``, and ``pp``.

.. |fork_chef| replace:: Indicates that a |chef| run will be contained in a secondary process with dedicated RAM. When the |chef| run is complete the RAM will be returned to the master process. This option helps ensure that a |chef client| will use a steady amount of RAM over time because the master process will not run recipes. This option will also help prevent memory leaks (such as those that can be introduced by the code contained within a poorly designed cookbook).

.. |fqdn| replace:: The |fully qualified domain name| of the host.

.. |freeze| replace:: Indicates that a cookbook cannot be modified; any changes to this cookbook must be included as a new version. Only the ``--force`` option can override this setting.

.. |fstype resource mount| replace:: Required. The file system type (fstype) of the device. Default value: ``nil``.
