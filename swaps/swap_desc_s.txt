For users of |git|, this will be the familiar SHA checksum. For users of |svn|, it will be the integer revision number. If a name other than a revision identifier is provided---branch names, tags, and so on---the |chef client| will ignore the alternate names and will look up the revision identifier and use it to name the release sub-directory.

For ``:reload``, the init script or other service provider can use a reload command. For ``:status``, the init script or other service provider can use a status command to determine if the service is running; if ``:status`` is not specified, the |chef client| will attempt to match the ``service_name`` against the process table as a regular expression, unless a pattern is specified as a parameter attribute.

.. |svn_username resource| replace:: The user name for a user that has access to the |svn| repository.

.. |symlink_before_migrate| replace:: Use this attribute to map files in a shared directory to the current release directory. The symbolic links for these files will be created before any migration is run. Use ``symlink_before_migrate({})`` or ``symlink_before_migrate nil`` instead of ``symlink_before_migrate {}`` because ``{}`` will be interpreted as a block rather than an empty hash. Set to ``nil`` to prevent the creation of default symbolic links.
.. |symlinks| replace:: Use this attribute to map files in a shared directory to their paths in the current release directory. This attribute runs after ``create_dirs_before_symlink`` and ``purge_before_symlink``.


.. |syntax_check_cache_path| replace:: All files in a cookbook must contain valid |ruby| syntax. Use this setting to specify the location in which |knife| caches information about files that have been checked for valid |ruby| syntax.
