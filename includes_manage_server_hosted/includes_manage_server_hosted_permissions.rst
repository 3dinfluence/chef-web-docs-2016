The **Management Console** allows users to manage permissions.


The Hosted Chef Management Console allows users with grant permissions to view and modify permissions on Roles, Nodes, Cookbooks, Databags, Clients, and Groups. For each type of object listed, there are two levels of permission settings: the global level and object level.

Permissions on the global level of an object type determines whether you are able to create new objects of this type and whether you can view the list of the objects of this type (for example, creating new groups and listing groups). Permissions on the object level determines whether you are able to do anything with that specific object (for example, showing, editing, or deleting the "foobar" group).
