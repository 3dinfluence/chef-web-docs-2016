Regenerating a client's private key invalidates the client's old private key and replaces it with a new one. Regenerating the key will be useful if you have lost the client's private key, if the client's private key has been exposed to someone you don't want to have access to your Hosted Chef account, or if you wish to regularly rotate keys for security purposes.
