This section explains how to download and use your private key, which is used to authenticate with Knife or directly via the REST APIs. For security purposes, Opscode does not keep a copy of this private key. We keep only the corresponding public key to verify your requests. Your private key is like a password or bank PIN number, so keep it safe.
