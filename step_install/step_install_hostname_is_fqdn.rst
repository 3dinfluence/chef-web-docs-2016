.. This is an included how-to. 


To verify if a hostname is a |fqdn|, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ hostname

If the hostname is a |fqdn|, it will return something like:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mychefserver.example.com

If the hostname is not a |fqdn|, it must be configured so that it is one.
