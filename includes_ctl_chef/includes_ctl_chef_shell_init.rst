The ``chef shell-init`` subcommand is used to set the |ruby| included in the |chef dk| as the system |ruby|. The |chef dk| is designed to allow the isolation of applications used by the |chef dk| from other |ruby| development tools that may be present on the workstation. This supports |bash|, |fish|, |windows powershell| (|posh|), and |zsh|.
