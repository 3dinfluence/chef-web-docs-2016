Once the user is created, download the private key. The private key is used for API access to |chef server oec|. |chef server oec| does not keep a copy of this key, so store it somewhere safe.

.. note:: If the |chef private| server is in |microsoft ad| or |ldap| mode, signup is unnecessary; log in to |chef private| using |microsoft ad| or |ldap| credentials.
