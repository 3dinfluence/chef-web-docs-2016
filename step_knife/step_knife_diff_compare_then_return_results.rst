.. This is an included how-to. 


To diff a node named ``node-lb`` and then only return files that have been added, deleted, modified, or changed, enter:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife diff --name-status node-lb

to return something like:

.. code-block:: bash

   node-lb/recipes/eip.rb
   node-lb/recipes/heartbeat-int.rb
   node-lb/templates/default/corpsite.conf.erb
   node-lb/files/default/wildcard.node.com.crt
   node-lb/files/default/wildcard.node.com.crt-2009
   node-lb/files/default/wildcard.node.com.key
   node-lb/.gitignore
   node-lb/Rakefile
