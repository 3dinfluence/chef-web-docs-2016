.. This is an included how-to. 


To see if a cookbook named ``redis`` with a version number of ``0.1.6`` is frozen, enter:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife cookbook show redis 0.1.6 | grep frozen

If the cookbook is frozen, something like the following is returned:

.. code-block:: bash

   frozen?:        true
