A useful method that is related to attributes is the ``attribute?`` method. This method will check for the existence of an attribute, so that processing can be done in an attributes file or recipe, but only if a specific attribute exists.

Using ``attribute?()`` in an attributes file:

.. code-block:: ruby

   if attribute?("ec2")
     # ... set stuff related to EC2
   end

Using ``attribute?()`` in a recipe:

.. code-block:: ruby

   if node.attribute?("ec2")
     # ... do stuff on EC2 nodes
   end
