A cookbook is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution. A cookbook defines a scenario and contains everything that is required to support that scenario:

* Recipes that specify the resources to use and the order in which they are to be applied
* Attribute values
* File distributions
* Templates
* Extensions to |chef|, such as libraries, definitions, and custom resources
