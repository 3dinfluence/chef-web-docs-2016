Where a resource represents a piece of the system, its current state, and the action that is needed to move it to a desired state, a provider defines the steps that are required to bring that piece of the system from its current state into a desired state. Because the action itself is de-coupled from the steps taken to complete that action, a provider must exist for each of the paths required to bring the system into the desired state. This is important because a single action may require different steps, depending on the platform of the system on which the action is to be taken.

For example, "install a package" is a single action (``action :install``) in a recipe, but the steps required to install a package may be different, depending on the platform. On a |redhat| or |centos| machine, a provider will use the |redhat yum| package provider to install a package; on a |debian| or an |ubuntu| machine, a provider will use the |apt| package installer. One action, two providers, each taking only the steps required to complete that action for the specific platform.
