.. This is an included how-to. 

To install the **knife-container** plugin, run one of the following commands. When using the |chef dk|:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef gem install knife-container

and when using |rubygems|:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem install knife-container

where ``/opt/chef/embedded/bin/`` is the path to the location in which the |chef client| looks for |knife| plugins. If the |chef client| was installed using |rubygems|, omit this path.
