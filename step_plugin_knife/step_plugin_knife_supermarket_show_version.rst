.. This is an included how-to. 


To show the details for a cookbook version, run a command similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife supermarket show mysql 0.10.0

where ``mysql`` is the cookbook and ``0.10.0`` is the cookbook version. This will return something similar to:

.. code-block:: bash
