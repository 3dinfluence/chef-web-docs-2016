.. This is an included how-to. 

To install the ``knife vcloud`` plugin using |rubygems|, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem install knife-vcloud

where ``/opt/chef/embedded/bin/`` is the path to the location where |chef| expects |knife| plugins to be installed when |chef| was installed using the omnibus installer. If |chef| was installed using |rubygems|, omit the path in the previous example.
