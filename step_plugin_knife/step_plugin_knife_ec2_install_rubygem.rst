.. This is an included how-to. 

To install the |subcommand knife ec2| plugin using |rubygems|, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem install knife-ec2

where ``/opt/chef/embedded/bin/`` is the path to the location where the |chef client| expects |knife| plugins to be located. If the |chef client| was installed using |rubygems|, omit the path in the previous example.
