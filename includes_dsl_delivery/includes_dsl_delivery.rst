The |dsl delivery| is a collection of helper methods that is used in recipes as a way to enhance the |dsl recipe| to collect data about:

* Which testing tools---|foodcritic|, |kitchen|, |chef spec|, and so on---are present in a cookbook?
* What types of delivery environments are available?
* Have files been changed?
* Do the changes made to a cookbook require a version change?
* Should a cookbook should be pushed to the |chef server| and/or to |github|?
