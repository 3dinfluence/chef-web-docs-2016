Use the |subcommand knife ssl_check| subcommand to verify the |ssl| configuration for the |chef server| or a location specified by a URL or URI. Invalid certificates will not be used by |open ssl|.

When this command is run, the certificate files (``*.crt`` and/or ``*.pem``) that are located in the |path trusted_certs| directory are checked to see if they have valid |x509| certificate properties. A warning is returned when certificates do not have valid |x509| certificate properties or if the |path trusted_certs| directory does not contain any certificates.

.. warning:: When verification of a remote server's |ssl| certificate is disabled, the |chef client| will issue a warning similar to "SSL validation of HTTPS requests is disabled. HTTPS connections are still encrypted, but the chef-client is not able to detect forged replies or man-in-the-middle attacks." To configure |ssl| for the |chef client|, set ``ssl_verify_mode`` to ``:verify_peer`` (recommended) **or** ``verify_api_cert`` to ``true`` in the |client rb| file.
