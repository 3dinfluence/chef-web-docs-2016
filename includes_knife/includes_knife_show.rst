Use the |subcommand knife show| subcommand to view the details of one (or more) objects on the |chef server|. This subcommand works similar to ``knife cookbook show``, ``knife data bag show``, ``knife environment show``, ``knife node show``, and ``knife role show``, but with a single verb (and a single action).
