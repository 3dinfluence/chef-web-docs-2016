Use the |subcommand knife delete| subcommand to delete an object from a |chef server|. This subcommand works similar to ``knife cookbook delete``, ``knife data bag delete``, ``knife environment delete``, ``knife node delete``, and ``knife role delete``, but with a single verb (and a single action).
