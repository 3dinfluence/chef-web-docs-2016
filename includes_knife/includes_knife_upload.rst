Use the |subcommand knife upload| subcommand to upload roles, cookbooks, environments, and data bags to the |chef server| from the current working directory in the |chef repo|. This subcommand is often used in conjunction with ``knife diff``, which can be used to see exactly what changes will be uploaded, and then ``knife download``, which does the opposite of ``knife upload``.
