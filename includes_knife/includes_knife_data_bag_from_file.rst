The ``from file`` argument is used to:

* Add a data bag item to a data bag
* Update the contents of an existing data bag item 

The data bag itself must already exist on the |chef server| and must be specified as part of the command. The contents of the data bag item are specified using a |json| file. This |json| file may be located at a relative or absolute path; its location must be specified as part of the command. The |json| file that defines the contents of the data bag item must at least contain the name of the data bag item---``"id": "name"``.

.. warning:: A |chef client| must be version 11.6 (or higher) when using the ``knife data bag from file`` argument with the |chef server oec| or |chef server osc| version 11 servers.
