A custom bootstrap template file (``template_filename``) must be located in a ``bootstrap/`` directory, typically located within the ``~/.chef/`` directory.

Use the ``--distro`` option with the ``knife bootstrap`` subcommand to specify the bootstrap template file. This location is configurable when the following settings are added to the |knife rb| file:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - ``knife[:distro]``
     - |distro|
   * - ``knife[:template_file]``
     - |path bootstrap_template| Do not use the ``--distro`` option when ``--template-file`` is specified.
