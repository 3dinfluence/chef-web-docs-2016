The ``edit`` argument is used to edit the details of a registered |chef api client|. When this argument is run, |knife| will open |chef editor| to enable editing of the ``admin`` attribute. (None of the other attributes should be changed using this argument.) When finished, |knife| will update the |chef server| with those changes.
