The following settings are often modified from the default as part of the tuning effort for the |service erchef| service:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - ``opscode_erchef['db_pool_size']``
     - |db_pool_size| This value should be increased if failures indicate that the |service erchef| service ran out of connections. This value should be tuned in conjunction with the ``postgresql['max_connections']`` setting for |postgresql|. Default value: ``20``.
   * - ``opscode_erchef['s3_url_ttl']``
     - |s3_url_ttl| If |chef client| runs are timing out, increase this setting to ``3600``, and then adjust again if necessary. Default value: ``900``.
