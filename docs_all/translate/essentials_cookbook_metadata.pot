When |knife| is used to create a cookbook, a |metadata rb| file is created automatically. In general, editing metadata should only be done using the |metadata rb| file and then either uploading the cookbook to the |chef server| or by asking the |chef server| to recompile the metadata into JSON data."

msgid "The |chef server| will only try to distribute the cookbooks that are needed to configure an individual node. This is determined by identifying the roles and recipes that are assigned directly to that system, and then to expand the list of dependencies, and then to deliver that entire set to the node. In some cases, if the dependency is not specified in the cookbook's metadata, the |chef server| may not treat that dependency as a requirement, which will result in an error message. If an error message is received from the |chef server| about cookbook distribution, verify the ``depends`` entries in the |metadata rb| file, and then try again."
