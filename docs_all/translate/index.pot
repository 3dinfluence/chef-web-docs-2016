msgid "This page contains the same, exact set of topics that are available from docs.opscode.com. These pages are organized differently. Instead of being broken down into smaller subsets of topics, they are consolidated into single-page groupings. For example, docs.opscode.com has individual URLs for every resource, |knife| sub-command, and lightweight resource, whereas this set of topics has three URLs, one each for resources, |knife|, and lightweight resources. If you want everything about search functionality in a single URL, use this one. If you only need to see information about Boolean operators, then this topic does that: http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_search_boolean_operators.html."

msgid "|chef| is a systems and cloud infrastructure automation framework that makes it easy to deploy servers and applications to any physical, virtual, or cloud location, no matter the size of the infrastructure. |chef| relies on abstract definitions (known as cookbooks and recipes) that are written in |ruby| and are managed like source code. Each definition describes how a specific part of your infrastructure should be built and managed. |chef| then applies those definitions to servers and applications, as specified, resulting in a fully automated infrastructure. When a new server comes online, the only thing that |chef| needs to know is which cookbooks and recipes to apply."
