msgid "|ruby| is a simple programming language that is designed to be easy to read and to behave in a predictable manner. |chef| uses |ruby| as its reference language for creating cookbooks and defining recipes, with an extended DSL (domain-specific language) that is used for specific resources. |chef| provides a reasonable set of resources, enough to support many of the most common infrastructure automation scenarios; however, this DSL can also be extended when additional resources and capabilities are required."

These settings are saved as |ruby| files and are stored in the |chef| repository. When these files are uploaded to the |chef server|, they are converted to |json|. Each time the |chef| repository is refreshed, the contents of all domain-specific |ruby| files are re-compiled to |json| and are re-uploaded to the |chef server|."
