Start handler functionality was added when |company_name| started building add-ons for the |chef server|. The |reporting| add-on is designed to create reporting data based on a |chef client| run. And since |reporting| needs to be able to collect data for the entire |chef client| run, |reporting| needs to be enabled before anything else happens at the start of the |chef client| run.
