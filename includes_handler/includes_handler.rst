A handler is used to trigger certain behaviors in response to specific situations, typically identified during a |chef client| run.

* An exception handler is used to trigger behaviors when a defined aspect of a |chef client| run fails.
* A report handler is used to trigger behaviors when a defined aspect of a |chef client| run is successful. 

Both types of handlers can be used to gather data about a |chef client| run and can provide rich levels of data about all types of usage, which can be used later for trending and analysis across the entire organization.
