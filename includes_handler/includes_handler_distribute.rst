A handler can be distributed using the |cookbook chef_handler| cookbook. This cookbook is authored and maintained by |opscode| and exposes an |lwrp| that can be used to enable custom handlers from within recipes and to include product-specific handlers from cookbooks. The |cookbook chef_handler| cookbook can be accessed here: https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef_handler. See the ``README.md`` for additional information.
