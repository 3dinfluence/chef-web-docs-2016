<h1>An Overview of Chef<a class="headerlink" href="#an-overview-of-chef" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Chef is a systems and cloud infrastructure automation framework that makes it easy to deploy servers and applications to any physical, virtual, or cloud location, no matter the size of the infrastructure. Chef relies on abstract definitions (known as cookbooks and recipes) that are written in Ruby and are managed like source code. Each definition describes how a specific part of your infrastructure should be built and managed. Chef then applies those definitions to servers and applications, as specified, resulting in a fully automated infrastructure. When a new node is brought online, the only thing that Chef needs to know is which cookbooks and recipes to apply.</p>
<p>The following diagram shows the relationships between the various elements of a Chef organization, including the nodes, the server, and the workstations. These elements work together to provide Chef the information and instruction that it needs so that it can do its job. As you are reviewing the rest of this doc, use the icons in the tables to refer back to this image.</p>
<img alt="_images/overview_chef_draft.png" src="_images/overview_chef_draft.png" />
<p>Chef comprises three main elements: a server, one (or more) nodes, and at least one workstation.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Chef Server acts as a hub that is available to every node in the Chef organization. This ensures that the right cookbooks (and recipes) are available, that the right policies are being applied, that the node object used during the previous Chef run is available to the current Chef run, and that all of the nodes that will be maintained by Chef are registered and known to the Chef Server.</li>
<li>The workstation is the location from which cookbooks (and recipes) are authored, policy data (such as roles, environments, and data bags) are defined, data is synchronized with the Chef repository, and data is uploaded to the Chef Server.</li>
<li>Each node contains a chef-client that performs the various infrastructure automation tasks that each node requires.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cookbooks are also a very important element of Chef and will be treated as a separate component (alongside the server, nodes, and the workstation) across the documentation. In general, the cookbooks are authored and managed from the workstation, moved to the Chef server, and then are pulled down to nodes by the chef-client during each Chef run.</p>
<p>The following sections discuss these elements (and their various components) in more detail.</p>
<div class="section" id="nodes">
<h2>Nodes<a class="headerlink" href="#nodes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A node is any server or virtual server that is configured to be maintained by a chef-client. A node can be physical or cloud-based. A Chef organization comprises any combination of physical and cloud-based nodes. A chef-client runs on each node. Ohai is used to collect data about the system so that it is available to the chef-client during every Chef run.</p>
<p>There are two types of nodes that Chef can manage:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="13%" />
<col width="88%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">Feature</th>

</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td><img alt="_images/icon_node_cloud.png" class="first last" src="_images/icon_node_cloud.png" />
</td>
<td>A cloud-based node is hosted in an external cloud-based service, such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, OpenStack, Rackspace, Google Compute Engine, Linode, or Windows Azure. Plugins are available for Knife that provide support for external cloud-based services. Knife can use these plugins to create instances on cloud-based services. Once created, Chef can be used to deploy, configure, and maintain those instances.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><img alt="_images/icon_node_physical.png" class="first last" src="_images/icon_node_physical.png" />
</td>
<td>A physical node is typically a server or a virtual machine, but it can be any active device attached to a network that is capable of sending, receiving, and forwarding information over a communications channel. In other words, a physical node is any active device attached to a network that can run a chef-client and communicate with a Chef Server.</td>

<p>Some important components on nodes include:</p>

</td>
<td><p class="first">A chef-client is an agent that runs locally on every node that is registered with the Chef Server. When a chef-client is run, it will perform all of the steps that are required to bring the node into the expected state, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Registering and authenticating the node with the Chef Server</li>
<li>Building the node object</li>
<li>Synchronizing cookbooks</li>
<li>Compiling the resource collection by loading each of the required cookbooks, including recipes, attributes, and all other dependencies</li>
<li>Taking the appropriate and required actions to configure the node</li>
<li>Looking for exceptions and notifications, handling each as required</li>
</ul>
<p class="last">Chef uses RSA public key-pairs to authenticate a chef-client with the Chef Server every time a chef-client needs access to data that is stored on the Chef Server. This prevents any node from accessing data that it shouldn&#8217;t and ensures that only nodes that are properly registered with the Chef server can be managed by Chef.</p>

<h2>Workstations<a class="headerlink" href="#workstations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A workstation is a computer that is configured to run Knife, to synchronize with the Chef repository, and interact with a single Chef Server. The workstation is the location from which most users of Chef will do most of their work, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Developing cookbooks and recipes (and authoring them using Ruby)</li>
<li>Keeping the Chef repository synchronized with version source control</li>
<li>Using Knife to upload items from the Chef repository to the Chef Server</li>
<li>Configuring organizational policy, including defining roles and environments and ensuring that critical data is stored in data bags</li>
<li>Interacting with nodes, as (or when) required, such as performing a bootstrap operation</li>

<p>Chef assumes that system administrators and developers know best about how the infrastructure should be put together. Chef makes as few decisions on its own as possible. When a decision must be made, Chef uses a reasonable default setting that can be easily changed by the system administrators and developers, most often by defining attributes in cookbooks that take precedence over the default attributes present on nodes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="chef-server">
<h2>Chef Server<a class="headerlink" href="#chef-server" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Chef Server acts as a hub for configuration data. The Chef Server stores cookbooks, the policies that are applied to cookbooks, and metadata that describes each registered node in the infrastructure. Nodes use the chef-client to ask the Chef Server for configuration details, such as recipes, templates, and file distributions. The chef-client then does as much of the configuration work as possible on the nodes themselves (and not on the Chef Server). This scalable approach distributes the configuration effort throughout the organization.</p>
<p>There are three types of Chef servers:</p>

<p class="last">Hosted Chef is based on the idea that an infrastructure management tool should be built around a collection of API primitives. By using an API to talk to a cloud provider (such as Amazon Virtual Private Cloud, Windows Azure, or Rackspace), it allows the freedom to think of those primitives as building blocks. Chef only needs to know about the desired state, how it should get there, and what the proper functionality of that desired state should be.</p>

<td>The open source Chef Server is a free version of the Chef Server that contains much of the same functionality as Hosted Chef, but requires that each instance be configured and managed locally, including performing data migrations, applying updates to the open source Chef Server, and ensuring that the open source Chef Server scales as the local infrastructure it is supporting grows. The open source Chef Server includes support from the Chef community, but does not include support directly from Opscode.</td>

<p>An API client is any machine that has permission to use the Chef Server API to communicate with the Chef Server. An API client is typically a node (on which the chef-client runs) or a workstation (on which Knife runs), but can also be any other machine configured to use the Chef Server API.</p>
<p>In addition to node objects, policy, and cookbooks, a Chef Server includes:</p>

<h3>Node Objects<a class="headerlink" href="#node-objects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For Chef, two important aspects of nodes are groups of attributes and run-lists. An attribute is a specific piece of data about the node, such as a network interface, a file system, the number of clients a service running on a node is capable of accepting, and so on. A run-list is an ordered list of recipes and/or roles that are run in an exact order. The node object consists of the run-list and node attributes, which is a JSON file that is stored on the Chef Server. The chef-client gets a copy of the node object from the Chef Server during each Chef run and places an updated copy on the Chef Server at the end of each Chef run.</p>
<p>Some important node objects include:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">

<li>What the state of the node should be at the end of the current Chef run</li>

<li>The node object that was saved to the Chef Server at the end of the previous Chef run</li>
<li>The rebuilt node object from the current Chef run, after it is updated for changes to cookbooks (attribute files and/or recipes), roles, and/or environments, and updated for any changes to the state of the node itself</li>
</ul>
<p class="last">After the node object is rebuilt, all of attributes are compared, and then the node is updated based on attribute precedence.

<div class="section" id="policy">
<h3>Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Policy settings can be used to map the capabilities of Chef to business and operational requirements, such as process and workflow. Roles define server types, such as &#8220;web server&#8221; or &#8220;database server&#8221;. Environments define process, such as &#8220;dev&#8221;, &#8220;staging&#8221;, or &#8220;production&#8221;. Certain types of data, such as passwords, user account data, and other sensitive items can be placed in data bags, which are located in a secure sub-area of Chef that can only be accessed by nodes that have the correct SSL certificates.</p>

<div class="section" id="cookbooks">
<h3>Cookbooks<a class="headerlink" href="#cookbooks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A cookbook is the fundamental unit of configuration and policy distribution in Chef. Each cookbook defines a scenario, such as everything needed to install and configure MySQL, and then it contains all of the components that are required to support that scenario, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Attribute values that are set on nodes</li>
<li>Definitions that allow the creation of reusable collections of resources</li>
<li>File distributions</li>
<li>Libraries that extend Chef and/or provide helpers to Ruby code</li>
<li>Recipes that specify which resources to manage and the order in which those resources will be applied</li>
<li>Custom resources and providers</li>
<li>Templates</li>
<li>Metadata about recipes (including dependencies), version constraints, supported platforms, and so on</li>
</ul>
<p>Chef uses Ruby as its reference language for creating cookbooks and defining recipes, with an extended DSL for specific resources. Chef provides a reasonable set of resources, enough to support many of the most common infrastructure automation scenarios; however, this DSL can also be extended when additional resources and capabilities are required.</p>

<td>A cookbook version represents a specific set of functionality that is different from the cookbook on which it is based. A version may exist for many reasons, such as ensuring that the correct version of third-party component is being used appropriately or providing an update to a cookbook that fixes a bug or adds a new improvement. A cookbook version can be defined using syntax and operators, it can be associated with environments, cookbook metadata, or run-lists, and it can be frozen (to prevent unwanted updates from being made). A cookbook version is handled just a cookbook with regard to how the repository sees a cookbook version, how cookbook versions are stored on the Chef Server, how cookbook versions are pushed out to nodes, and how cookbook versions are used during a Chef run.</td>

<p>Chef will run a recipe only when asked. When Chef runs the same recipe more than once, the results will be the same system state each time. When a recipe is run against a system, but nothing has changed on either the system or in the recipe, Chef won&#8217;t change anything.</p>
<p>In addition to attributes, recipes, and versions, the following items are also part of cookbooks:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Resources and providers. A resource is a package, a service, a group of users, and so on. A resource tells Chef which provider to use during a Chef run for various tasks like installing packages, running Ruby code, or accessing directories and file systems. The resource is generic: &#8220;install program A&#8221; while the provider knows what to do with that process on Debian and Ubuntu and Microsoft Windows. A provider defines the steps that are required to bring that piece of the system into the desired state. Chef includes default providers that cover all of the most common scenarios.</li>
<li>File distributions. A file distribution is a specific type of resource that tells a cookbook how to distribute files, including by node, by platform, or by file version.</li>
<li>Definitions. A definition is used to create new resources by stringing together one (or more) existing resources.</li>
<li>Libraries. A library allows the use of arbitrary Ruby code in a cookbook, either as a way to extend the Chef language or to implement a new class.</li>
<li>Templates. A template is a file written in markup language that uses Ruby statements to solve complex configuration scenarios.</li>
<li>Configuration files. A metadata file to ensure that each cookbook is correctly deployed to each node.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The key underlying principle of Chef is that you (the user) knows best about what your environment is, what it should do, and how it should be maintained. Chef is designed to not make assumptions about any of those things. Only the individuals on the ground&#8212;that&#8217;s you and your team&#8212;understand the technical problems and what is required to solve them. Only your team can understand the human problems (skill levels, audit trails, and other internal issues) that are unique to your organization and whether any single technical solution is viable.</p>
<p>The idea that you know best about what should happen in your organization goes hand-in-hand with the notion that you still need help keeping it all running. It is rare that a single individual knows everything about a very complex problem, let alone knows all of the steps that may be required to solve them. The same is true with tools. Chef provides help with infrastructure management. And Chef can help solve very complicated problems. Chef also has a large community of users who have a lot of experience solving a lot of very complex problems. That Chef community can provide knowledge and support in areas that your organization may not have and (along with Chef) can help your organization solve any complex problem.</p>
