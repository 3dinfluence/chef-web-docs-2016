Initial User Creation
You must create a new user account before using Private Chef.

Note
If your server is in Active Directory/LDAP mode, signup is unnecessary and you can simply log in to Chef using your credentials.
Visiting the Private Chef management console will present you with a Login page, which contains a Sign Up link:


Enter your information on the signup page, and click Submit.


Once your user is created, you will have the opportunity to download your private key - download it now. This key is used for API access to Private Chef. Private Chef does not keep a copy of this key, so please store it somewhere safe.


Initial Organization Creation
If you are following along with a private chef installation and have not done so already, now is a good time to create an organization Organization Creation
