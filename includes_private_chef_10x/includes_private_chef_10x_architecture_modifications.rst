The three supported Private Chef topologies discussed in this guide are the product of our experiences with Hosted Chef and, we feel, will provide our customers with the best Chef platform for their environments. As of this writing, Hosted Chef is still the largest Chef environment in existence, and we continue to use what we learn from customer feedback to make improvements.

Private Chef is software, and many of the components are familiar to our customers and in use in other parts of their environments. However, we have provided you with the best configuration for these components to meet the needs and idiosyncrasies of Private Chef. By employing one of the three topologies discussed in this guide, our support team will be able to help you with any issues that may arise in your environment, and we’ll be able to deliver you updates and upgrades in a consistent manner that will keep your data safe. Deviation from these topologies reduces our capability to help you when things don’t work as they should, and that makes us sad.

We know that many of our customers are talented and knowledgeable technical people, and have experience running many of the components that are included as part of Private Chef. Your environment may have an existing runbook or best practice for any or all of these components individually already. We ask that you treat your Private Chef system as its own entity for optimal performance.

We value your feedback and input on any questions, concerns, and issues you have with Private Chef. Our team is open to suggestions and community participation is encouraged, especially on our IRC channel and at our events. While we are not able to make extensive customizations for Private Chef installations, your feedback will help us decide on future development on the product that we can officially provide support for.

The rest of this document serves as a FAQ of commonly requested modifications to Private Chef.
