Customer will communicate incidents to |opscode| in one of the following manners:

* Use the web interface http://help.opscode.com/ to directly open a trouble ticket at that site, or
* Direct an email to |chef private| Support (support@opscode.com), with the sending email address being one of those associated with Customer's organization on Private Chef.

Please note that the |opscode| Support Phone Number (|opscode support phone|) is for contact only.

* Depending upon the specifics of the issue, it is highly unlikely that real-time analysis and resolution can occur over the phone.
* The phone call can initiate support response, but the following will be required from the customer prior to engaging support. This will ensure meaningful action can be effectively and efficiently undertaken for problem resolution.
* Customer documentation of the issue, as experienced from their perspective and particular use case.
* Documentation of any actions taken immediately prior to the issues occurrence (if any), and
* Documentation of any actions taken to troubleshoot or attempted direct resolution that the customer undertook prior to engaging |chef hosted| Support.
* Following using the Support Phone to initiate contact, the required information can be provided by the customer through either of the previously detailed means.

|opscode| will validate that the individual communicating the incident is authorized by Customer to engage support.

* This avoids an unauthorized engagement of support, and the potential incident overage charges that could occur for Customer.
* Those who seek support, who arenâ€™t authorized, will be redirected to those who Customer has authorized as determined in Contact Personnel.

For all authorized contacts, |opscode| will generate a single response for each trouble ticket that is received from Customer, within the support hours of operation as shown above, to confirm receipt of the incident report and the initiation of appropriate response actions.

|opscode| sets the initial classification of the trouble ticket and responds based upon that classification, unless otherwise agreed between |opscode| and Customer. See Incident Handling and Updates for details on |opscode| response.
