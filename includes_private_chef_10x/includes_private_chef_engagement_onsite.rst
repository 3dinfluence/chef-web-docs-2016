On-Site Installation

Once the pre-installation tasks are verified, your Primary Consultant will arrive on-site to perform the installation (they may be accompanied by the Secondary Consultant as well.)


Verify account privileges

The first step on-site is to verify that the Consultants have access to the Private Chef servers, with appropriate levels of access.


Verify prerequisites

They will then verify that the prerequisite tasks have been completed satisfactorily, in particular the required network access and the operating system configuration.


Installation of Private Chef

Once the consultants have ensured the prerequisites are met, the installation of |chef private| will begin. The servers will be connected to the |chef hosted| service, in order to build and configure the services.


Configuration of HA Services

Once the baseline configuration has been applied, the consultants will then apply the HA configuration to |chef private|.


Validation

At this point |chef private| will be installed and running. The consultants will then validate that each service is running and the system is fully functional.

Consultants will verify, with the client, at a minimum:

* Accessibility of the Management Console
* User Creation
* Organization Creation
* Client Creation
* Node Creation
* Cookbook Uploading
* Chef Client Run completion
* Search
* Backup Snapshot creation
* High Availability
* Administrative Training

After having validated that |chef private| is functioning properly, we will walk your designated staff through administering |chef private|. At a minimum, we will cover:

* Log location
* Service start/stop/restart
* Basic troubleshooting
* Cluster failover
* Walkthrough of the Support Process
