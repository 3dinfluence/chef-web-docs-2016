As of this writing, your Private Chef installation will run with a PostgreSQL back-end. This decision was the culmination of a lengthy performance review of various data store technologies, as well as a careful review of the legalities of shipping you Private Chef with components of differing license types.

At some point in the not-far-off future, MySQL will be supported as a datastore option in place of PostgreSQL for Private Chef installations. When we are ready to fully support MySQL for our customers, we will provide you with a supported migration path to ensure that your environment is fully functional after the switch.

Until that time, all Private Chef installations will run PostgreSQL. We will be letting our customers know when MySQL will be available.
