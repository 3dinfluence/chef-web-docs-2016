Customer shall provide |opscode| with access to Customer's Network and Systems if jointly deemed necessary to support resolution of Customer reported issue.

This access must include the following where appropriate:

#. The ability to connect to the system(s) that are experiencing the issue.
#. The ability to review full server and client logs.
#. The ability to review network logs.

This could be particularly critical in responding to Severity 1 or Severity 2 incidents in a timely manner. Customer should ensure the means of granting such accesses are in place and ready to be used in advance of their need, as much as possible.

Time which passes during the granting of necessary accesses, and/or to establish the means of granting said accesses, will be excluded from any consideration in the meeting of Customer Response Targets defined in Incident Severity.
