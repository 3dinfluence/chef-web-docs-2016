Escalation procedures are in place at |opscode| to manage the resolution of incidents when they occur. All referenced communications and escalations are available based upon those hours, as listed in Support Service Hours.

The Incident Severity determines the escalation timeline. If the incident remains open after the time indicated, |opscode| escalates stewardship of issue resolution to the next level, to ensure appropriate resources are aligned and focused on addressing its resolution.  The following table provides escalation timelines for Severity 1 and 2 incidents, based on time after the incident was received during service hours.

================ ============================= ========== ==========
Escalation Level Escalation Contact            Severity 1 Severity 2
================ ============================= ========== ==========
Level 1	         Private Chef Support Engineer 1 hour     2 hours
Level 2	         Management                    2 hours    4 hours
Level 3	         Senior Management             3 hours    8 hours
Level 4          Executive                     4 hours    24 hours

Severity 3 incidents seldom require escalation but in the event that Customer believes that |opscode| is not addressing the incident in a timely manner, the parties can mutually agree to elevate the priority of the incident, and treat it as a Severity 2 incident. Customer can pursue that increase in severity classification by following the process detailed in Customer Escalation to |opscode|.
