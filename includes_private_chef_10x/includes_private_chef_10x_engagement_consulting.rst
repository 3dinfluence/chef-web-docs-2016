How Opscode Consulting Works

Initial Engagement

You will be provided with access to a client-specific project portal, through which we coordinate and share the progress on the scope of work, and where you can ask questions of the |opscode| staff. In order to access the client portal, you must provide |opscode| the following information about your company:

* Company Name
* Mailing Address
* Country
* Time Zone (for the primary contact)
* Web Address
* Phone Number
* Fax Number
* Primary point of contact

Your primary point of contact should be empowered to make decisions on behalf of the company regarding the work performed, and will be our point of contact for any questions that come up during the engagement. Additionally, you may provide up to 5 other individuals who can access the client portal. For each individual, you must provide |opscode| the following:

* Full Name
* Email
* Title
* Office Phone Number, including extension
* Mobile Phone Number
* Fax Number
* Preferred Instant Messaging Name (on Skype, Google, or MSN)

This information should be sent via email to consulting@opscode.com.

Each point of contact will receive an email inviting them to join the |opscode| Client Portal, and will then have access to the project we’re using to manage your |chef private| installation. Login information will be included in this email.

|opscode| will provide you with a Primary Consultant, who will be your primary point of contact for the engagement, and a Secondary Consultant, who will be available in the absence of the Primary Consultant. |opscode| may assign new consultants, either in addition to or in place of, those initially assigned.






Using the Project Portal


Logging In

To access the portal, open a web browser and navigate to:

http://opscode.basecamphq.com

You will be presented with a login screen similar to the following:

.. image:: project_portal_login_screen

Input the Username and Password you created during the sign-up process.



Project Overview

When you log in to your Project, you will first be taken to an overview screen. This screen will present a history of recent activity on your project. It’s a great way to see at a glance what’s new with your project.

.. image:: project_portal_overview

The most common activities listed will consist of Messages, To-Dos, and Writeboards.



Messages

Messages are the primary means of communication between you and |opscode|. If you have a question for us, post a message to your project. Similarly, if we have questions for you, status updates, or other information to share, we will be posting them as messages for you. The use of Messages is highly preferred to emailing your consultants directly - it allows us to ensure that everyone involved in providing your services knows what is happening, and provides you a record of events should you need to review.

If you do send consultants email directly, they will post it as a message to your client portal, to ensure it is cataloged for posterity.

To send us a message:

#. Click the "Messages" tab
   .. image:: project_portal_message_tab
#. Click "Post a new Message"
   .. image:: project_portal_post_message
#. Fill in the message Title and Body. Our consultants are notified automatically, but if the message is urgent, feel free to notify them via Email as well by clicking next to their name.

#. Click "Post this message"

To-Dos

Each phase of the project will have one or more To-Do lists created, which are used to track deliverables (both from |opscode| to You, and from You to |opscode|.) As each task is performed, it will be crossed off the list - To-Do lists are a great way to see, at a glance, how the work on your project is going, and how much work remains.

Most often, you will be accessing the To-Do tab to either review a particular phases status, or to cross off a To-Do item yourself.

To access the To-Do lists:

#. Click the “To-Dos” tab.
   .. image:: project_portal_todo_tab
#. From here, you can easily view all of the active To-Do lists. To cross off an item, simply click the checkbox.

Writeboards

Writeboards provide a collaborative workspace for editing documents. In many cases, |opscode| uses them to provide a starting place for customer requirements or prerequisites. As we learn more about the environment, we will collaboratively edit the Writeboard to update it with the most relevant data.

For example, on Private Chef Installation engagements, a Writeboard is created to track any changes to Server Specifications, and to keep notes during the engagement.

To access a Writeboard:

#. Click the “Writeboards” tab.
   .. image:: project_portal_writeboard_tab
#. Select the Writeboard you wish to view or edit.
   .. image:: project_portal_select_writeboard
#. Once viewing the Writeboard, you can click the “Edit this page” button to edit, or simply scroll to view the document.
   .. image:: project_portal_edit_writeboard




During the Engagement

As work progresses on your project, we will be keeping in touch via the Project Portal. As tasks are completed, we will be checking them off the relevant To-Do lists, and we will be posting a summary status message for each day that work occurs on your project, reviewing the progress that day.

If you have questions about the project, please post a message to the portal.



When the Engagement is finished

When the engagement is finished, we will post any final deliverables to your project portal and will schedule an acceptance meeting. In this meeting, we will review the acceptance criteria for your project, and ensure that you are satisfied with results. When both you and |opscode| have signed off on the acceptance criteria, the engagement is complete.

In addition to the acceptance meeting, we will schedule a short customer satisfaction meeting to review your experience with |opscode| Consulting. We encourage you to be as candid as possible - only through understanding your experience can we ensure the quality of our work, both for your company and those we engage with in the future.
