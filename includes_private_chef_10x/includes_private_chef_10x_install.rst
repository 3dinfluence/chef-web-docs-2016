Installation
We’re excited to help you install Private Chef!

Your first step is to make sure you meet the universal prerequisites - regardless of how you install Private Chef, you’ll need to make sure these steps are complete.

Next, this guide provides details on 3 different installation options:

Standalone Private Chef on a single server
Tiered: Private Chef on multiple servers
High Availability: Private Chef on multiple servers with a highly available data storage layer
Your Opscode representative can provide guidance on which option is right for your environment. If you are in doubt, follow the standalone installation.

Once you have Private Chef installed, you’ll want to move on to creating a user and creating an organization.
