There are already detailed recommendations for network configuration in the `OpenStack Operations Guide <http://docs.openstack.org/ops/>`_ and in the `Rackspace Private Cloud Installation Prerequisites and Concepts <http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/rackspace-private-cloud-installation-prerequisites-and-concepts#network-prereq>`_, **Chef for OpenStack** does not have any additional requirements, but this documentation will be updated to list the supported options.
