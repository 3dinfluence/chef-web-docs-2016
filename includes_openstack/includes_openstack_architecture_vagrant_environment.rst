The environment that is used when testing |vagrant| with upstream cookbooks and the reference |chef repo| is shown below. It defines the network and database settings that are used with |openstack|. The networks will be used in the libraries provided by the ``osops-utils`` cookbook. The following example shows a FlatDHCP with two physical networks.
