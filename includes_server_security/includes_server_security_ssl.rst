Configuration of |ssl| for the |chef server| using certificate authority-verified certificates is done by placing the certificate and private key file obtained from the certifying authority in the correct files after the initial configuration of |chef server|.

Initial configuration of the |chef server| is done automatically using a self-signed certificate to create the certificate and private key files for |nginx|.

The locations of the certificate and private key files are 

* ``/var/opt/opscode/nginx/ca/FQDN.crt``
* ``/var/opt/opscode/nginx/ca/FQDN.key``

Because the |fqdn| has already been configured, do the following:

#. Replace the contents of ``/var/opt/opscode/nginx/ca/FQDN.crt`` and ``/var/opt/opscode/nginx/ca/FQDN.key`` with the certifying authority's files.
#. Reconfigure the |chef server|:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

#. Restart the |nginx| service to load the new key and certificate:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ chef-server-ctl restart nginx
