There are a number of platform-specific resources available for package management. In general, the |resource package| resource will use the correct package manager based on the platform-specific details collected by |ohai| at the start of the |chef client| run, which means that the platform-specific resources are often unnecessary. That said, there are cases when using a platform-specific package-based resource is desired. See the following resources for more information about these platform-specific resources: ``apt_package``, ``chef_gem``, ``dpkg_package``, ``easy_install_package``, ``freebsd_package``, ``gem_package``, ``ips_package``, ``macports_package``, ``openbsd_package``, ``pacman_package``, ``paludis_package``, ``portage_package``, ``rpm_package``, ``smartos_package``, ``solaris_package``, and ``yum_package``.
