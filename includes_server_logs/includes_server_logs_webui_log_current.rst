The |service webui| service's ``current.log`` file contains a history of all requests that were made to the |chef server| web user interface. Errors that may be found in this log are typically the cause of failed HTTP requests that were made to another service. The following is an example log entry for a successful request:

.. code-block:: ruby

   2013-08-06_16:03:53.50265  Started GET "/nodes" for 172.28.0.148 at 2013-08-06 16:03:53 +0000
   2013-08-06_16:03:53.50462  Processing by NodesController#index as HTML
   2013-08-06_16:03:54.29635  Rendered nodes/_navigation.html.haml (11.5ms)
   2013-08-06_16:03:54.29741  Rendered nodes/index.html.haml within layouts/application (36.5ms)
   2013-08-06_16:03:54.31334  Completed 200 OK in 808ms (Views: 59.0ms)
   2013-08-06_16:03:54.31447  cache: [GET /nodes] miss

A failed request, on the other hand produces a large amount of output. The following is a partial example log entry for a failed request:

.. code-block:: ruby

   2013-08-06_16:05:15.45445  Started GET "/clients" for 172.28.0.148 at 2013-08-06 16:05:15 +0000
