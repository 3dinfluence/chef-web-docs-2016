The ``int`` subcommand is used to send a ``SIGINT`` to all services. This command can also be run for an individual service by specifying the name of the service in the command.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ opscode-analytics-ctl int name_of_service

where ``name_of_service`` represents the name of any service that is listed after running the ``service-list`` subcommand.
