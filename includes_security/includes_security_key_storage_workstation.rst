Each workstation stores its private key in the |chef repo|. This private key is generated by the |chef server| and must be download from the server and copied to the ``.chef`` directory in the |chef repo|. If a new private key is required, simply regenerate it from the |chef server| and re-copy it to the |chef repo|.
