The |chef compliance| server is a centralized location from which all aspects of the state or your infrastructure's compliance can be managed.

* Create and manage profiles of rules; use them to test any node in your infrastructure, including all of the common |unix| and |linux| platforms and most versions of |windows|
* Continuously test any node against the goals of your organization's security management lifecycle
* Each scan is fully executed remotely; there is nothing to clean up when the scan is complete because nothing was installed on the node
* Reports show the results of compliance runs and help to ensure the nodes in your infrastructure meet your security requirements
* View compliance statistics for any node
