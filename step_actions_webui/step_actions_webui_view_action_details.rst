The actions view always shows the most recent actions, including a one-line summary of what happend. For example: "Client dg created node - db a day ago." Each action in the view may be expanded to show action details, including the name and request identifier of the |chef client| and the name of the |chef server| instances involved in the action.

Every user in |chef analytics| has a picture that is associated with the entry that is created as a result of an action they perform. For the |chef client|, it's a picture of a computer screen (always). And for users, the images are fetched from gravatar.com, based on the email address associated with that user. If that user has uploaded a picture to gravatar.com, that picture will be used.

To view action details:

#. Open |chef analytics|.
#. Choose an action and expand it.
