Then configure the same value for the ``bookshelf['vip']`` setting prior to installing |chef server osc|. For example: ``api_fqdn "chef.example.com"``.
   * - ``bookshelf['vip']``
     - |ip_address virtual| Default value: ``node['fqdn']``. (This setting is related to the |service bookshelf| service.)
