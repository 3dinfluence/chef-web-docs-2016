Define a custom resource. A custom resource typically contains:

* A list of defined custom properties (property values are specified in recipes)
* At least one action (actions tell the |chef client| what to do)
* For each action, a collection of resources---|resource package|, |resource service|, |resource directory|, and |resource template|---that define the steps required to complete the desired action
