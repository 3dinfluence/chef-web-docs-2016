This article assumes that a cookbook directory named ``website`` exists in a |chef repo| with (at least) the following directories and file names:

.. code-block:: text

   /website
     metadata.rb
     /recipes
     README.md
     /resources
     /templates

See https://docs.chef.io/ctl_chef.html for more information about how to use the ``chef`` command-line tool that is packaged with the |chef dk| to build the |chef repo|, plus related cookbook sub-directories.
