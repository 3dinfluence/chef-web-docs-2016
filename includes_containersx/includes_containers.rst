Containers are an approach to virtualization that allow a single operating system to host many working configurations, including even the host operating system. Each working configuration is assigned a single responsibility that is isolated from all other responsibilities. Each container comprises a working configuration and all of its dependencies that are not already available from the host operating system or from another container that is also running on the host operating system.
