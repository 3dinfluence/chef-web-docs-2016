.. This is an included how-to. 

If you only want certain people to have access to this key, consider adding it to an encrypted data bag. Other options include adding it to the |chef repo|, using ``deploy_to`` property and the |resource deploy| resource, and so on.

To add a private key to a node:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "id": "app",
     "repository": "git@github.com:acctname/private-repo.git",
     "deploy_key": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n
                    MIIEogIBAAKCAQEAoEN9TWqCSMvdfjke\n
                    ...truncated...",
     "deploy_to": "/tmp/private_code"
   }

Convert new lines in the private key to ``\n`` when copying it to the data bag. Then use the |resource file| resource within the recipe to add it to the node:

.. code-block:: ruby

   app = Chef::EncryptedDataBagItem.load('deploytest', 'app')
   
   file '/tmp/private_code/.ssh/id_deploy' do
     content app['deploy_key']
     owner 'ubuntu'
     mode '0600'
   end
