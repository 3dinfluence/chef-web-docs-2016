.. This is an included how-to. 


The |resource execute| resource cannot be used to source a file (e.g. ``command "source filename"``). The following example will fail because ``source`` is not an executable:

.. code-block:: ruby

   execute "foo" do
     command "source /tmp/foo.sh"
   end

Instead, use the |resource script| resource or one of the |resource script|-based resources (|resource script_bash|, |resource script_csh|, |resource script_perl|, |resource script_python|, or |resource script_ruby|). For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   bash "foo" do
     code "source /tmp/foo.sh"
   end
