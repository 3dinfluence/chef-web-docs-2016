The ``server delete`` argument is used to delete one or more instances that are running in the |rackspace| cloud. The corresponding node on the |chef| server can also be deleted with the same action. To find a specific cloud instance, use the ``knife rackspace server list`` argument. Use the ``knife node delete`` and ``knife client delete`` sub-commands to delete associated node and client objects (if required).
