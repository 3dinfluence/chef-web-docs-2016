A |knife| plugin is a set of one (or more) subcommands that can be added to |knife| to support additional functionality that is not built-in to the base set of |knife| subcommands. Many of the |knife| plugins are built by members of the |company_name| community and several of them are built and maintained by |company_name|. A |knife| plugin is installed to the |path knife plugins| directory, from where it can be run just like any other |knife| subcommand.
