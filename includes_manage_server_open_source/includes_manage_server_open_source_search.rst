You can view search indexes and search for nodes, API clients, roles, and data bags on the **Management Console**.

Viewing Available Search Indexes
=====================================================
In order to view available search indexes, log on to the **Management Console** and click the **Search** tab. The search indexes should be listed. Nodes, roles, and clients are always available. Data bags are indexed by the data bag's name.

Searching
=====================================================
The query syntax described in the **Search** page also applies to the **Management Console**. The very basic syntax is ``attribute:value``. If you do not enter anything in any search box, it searches for everything (``*:*``).
