Most of code that is authored when working with |chef| is written as |ruby|. Much of the time the |ruby| that is used with |chef| just follows patterns. For example, many resource blocks follow similar patterns and the attributes defined within them are typically simple name/value pairs. Just about every file within a cookbook---with few exceptions!---is a |ruby| file.
