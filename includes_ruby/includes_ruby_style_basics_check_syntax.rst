Many people who are new to |ruby| often find that it doesn't take very long to get up to speed with the basics. For example, it's useful to know how to check the syntax of a |ruby| file, such as the contents of a cookbook named ``my_cookbook.rb``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ruby -c my_cookbook_file.rb

to return:

.. code-block:: bash

   Syntax OK
