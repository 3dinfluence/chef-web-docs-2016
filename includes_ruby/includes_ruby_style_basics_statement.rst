Use conditions! For example, an ``if`` statement

.. code-block:: ruby

   if false
     # this won't happen
   elsif nil
     # this won't either
   else
     # code here will run though
   end

or a ``case`` statement:

.. code-block:: ruby

   x = "dog"
   case x
   when "fish"
    # this won't happen
   when "dog", "cat", "monkey"
     # this will run
   else
     # the else is an optional catch-all
   end
