Do some basic arithmetic:
 
.. code-block:: ruby

   1 + 2           # => 3

.. code-block:: ruby

   2 * 7           # => 14

.. code-block:: ruby

   5 / 2           # => 2   (because both arguments are whole numbers)

.. code-block:: ruby

   5 / 2.0         # => 2.5 (because one of the numbers had a decimal place)

.. code-block:: ruby

   1 + (2 * 3)     # => 7   (you can use parens to group expressions)
