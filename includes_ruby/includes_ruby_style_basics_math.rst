Do some basic arithmetic:
 
.. code-block:: ruby

   1 + 2           # => 3
   2 * 7           # => 14
   5 / 2           # => 2   (because both arguments are whole numbers)
   5 / 2.0         # => 2.5 (because one of the numbers had a decimal place)
   1 + (2 * 3)     # => 7   (you can use parens to group expressions)
