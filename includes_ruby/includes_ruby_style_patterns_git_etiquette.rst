Although not strictly a |chef| style thing, please always ensure your ``user.name`` and ``user.email`` are set properly in your ``.gitconfig`` file.

* ``user.name`` should be your given name (e.g., "Julian Dunn")
* ``user.email`` should be an actual, working e-mail address

This will prevent commit log entries similar to ``"guestuser <login@Bobs-Macbook-Pro.local>"``, which are unhelpful.
