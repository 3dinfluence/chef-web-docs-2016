Use |perl|-style regular expressions:

.. code-block:: ruby

   "I believe"  =~ /I/                       # => 0 (matches at the first character)
   "I believe"  =~ /lie/                     # => 4 (matches at the 5th character)
   "I am human" =~ /bacon/                   # => nil (no match - bacon comes from pigs)
   "I am human" !~ /bacon/                   # => true (correct, no bacon here)
   /give me a ([0-9]+)/ =~ "give me a 7"     # => 0 (matched)
