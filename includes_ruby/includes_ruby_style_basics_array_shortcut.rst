The ``%w`` syntax is a |ruby| shortcut for creating an array without requiring quotes and commas around the elements.

For example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   if %w{debian ubuntu}.include?(node["platform"])
     # do debian/ubuntu things with the Ruby array %w{} shortcut
   end 

.. 
.. The ``%w`` array will use single-quotes, will not have access to code interpolation, and may only use a limited set of escape characters: ``\``.
.. 
.. .. note:: Use an upper-case W---``%W``---to create an array with double-quotes, access to code interpolation, and access to all escape characters.
