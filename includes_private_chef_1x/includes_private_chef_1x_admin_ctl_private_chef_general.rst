   * - Command
     - Description
   * - ``help``
     - Print a list of all the available |private chef ctl| commands.
   * - ``reconfigure``
     - When changes are made to ``/etc/opscode/private-chef.rb``, the |private chef ctl| reconfigure command is used to dynamically reconfigure the server. Until this command is run, no changes have been made to the configuration of any of the private chef services.
   * - ``show-config``
     - View the configuration that will be generated by |private chef ctl| reconfigure. This is useful in the early stages of a deployment, to ensure that everything will be built properly prior to installation.
   * - ``cleanse``
     - The cleanse command re-sets a server to the state it was in before the first run of |private chef ctl| reconfigure. It will destroy all the data, configuration files, and logs.
   * - ``uninstall``
     - The uninstall command is intended to be run before removing |chef private| from a system when you wish to uninstall the |chef private| software but do not want to delete its data. The uninstall command will completely shut down all services, including the ``runit`` process supervisor. To revert an uninstall command, a user would need to run |private chef ctl| reconfigure, since |private chef ctl| start will have its functionality disabled by the pre-uninstall.
