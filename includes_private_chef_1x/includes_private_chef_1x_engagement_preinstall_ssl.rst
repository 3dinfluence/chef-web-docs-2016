|chef private| uses SSL to encrypt traffic between every |chef client| and the |chef server|. As part of the Server and Network requirements, you will give each of the systems hostnames in DNS. Once you have supplied these hostnames, you will need to either:

* Provide SSL certificates for the Hostnames
* Allow us to provide self-signed certificates
