Messages are the primary means of communication between you and |opscode|. If you have a question for us, post a message to your project. Similarly, if we have questions for you, status updates, or other information to share, we will be posting them as messages for you. The use of Messages is highly preferred to emailing your consultants directly---it allows us to ensure that everyone involved in providing your services knows what is happening, and provides you a record of events should you need to review.

If you do send consultants email directly, they will post it as a message to your client portal, to ensure it is cataloged for posterity.

To send us a message:

#. Click the "Messages" tab
   .. image:: project_portal_message_tab
#. Click "Post a new Message"
   .. image:: project_portal_post_message
#. Fill in the message Title and Body. Our consultants are notified automatically, but if the message is urgent, feel free to notify them via Email as well by clicking next to their name.
