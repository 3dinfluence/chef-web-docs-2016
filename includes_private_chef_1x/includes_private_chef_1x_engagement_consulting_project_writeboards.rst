Writeboards provide a collaborative workspace for editing documents. In many cases, |opscode| uses them to provide a starting place for customer requirements or prerequisites. As we learn more about the environment, we will collaboratively edit the Writeboard to update it with the most relevant data.

For example, on |chef private| Installation engagements, a Writeboard is created to track any changes to Server Specifications, and to keep notes during the engagement.

To access a Writeboard:

#. Click the Writeboards tab.
   .. image:: project_portal_writeboard_tab
#. Select the Writeboard you wish to view or edit.
   .. image:: project_portal_select_writeboard
#. Once viewing the Writeboard, you can click the Edit this page button to edit, or simply scroll to view the document.
