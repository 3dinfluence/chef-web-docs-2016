Congratulations! You have now set up |chef private| to work with Active Directory or LDAP.

At this point, all users will use their Active Directory or LDAP username and password to log in to |chef private|. The first time they log in, they can either create a new account linked to their Active Directory credentials or link an existing Chef account to their Active Directory credentials.

You should now continue with the Active Directory/LDAP section of this guide.
