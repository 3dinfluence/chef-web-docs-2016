Congratulations! You have now set up |chef private| to work with |windows ad| or |ldap|.

At this point, all users will use their |windows ad| or |ldap| username and password to log in to |chef private|. The first time they log in, they can either create a new account linked to their |windows ad| credentials or link an existing |chef private| account to their |windows ad| credentials.

You should now continue with the |windows ad| / |ldap| section of this guide.
