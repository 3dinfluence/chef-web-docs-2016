Each user account on a |chef private| server has a private key that allows them API access to |chef private|. The |chef private| server does not store a copy of this key. If you misplace this key, you will need to regenerate it in order to restore API access for your user. You can regenerate this key from your user profile page. You are not permitted to regenerate a key for a user account that is not your own.
