A control is an automated test that is built into a cookbook, and then used to test the state of the system for compliance. Compliance can be many things. For example, ensuring that file and directory management meets specific internal IT policies---"Does the file exist?", "Do the correct users or groups have access to this directory?". Compliance may also be complex, such as helping to ensure goals defined by large-scale compliance frameworks such as |pci|, |hipaa|, and |sarbanes oxley| can be met.
