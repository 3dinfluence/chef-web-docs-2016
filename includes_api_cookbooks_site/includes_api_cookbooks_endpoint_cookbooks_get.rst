The ``GET`` method is used to get a listing of the available cookbooks. Use the ``start`` and ``items`` parameters to set limits on the number of cookbooks returned. Use the ``order`` parameter to change the way results are sorted. Use the ``user`` parameter to filter cookbooks by maintainer:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Parameter
