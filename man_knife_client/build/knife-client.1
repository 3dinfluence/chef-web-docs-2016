.sp
When a node runs chef\-client for the first time, it generally does not yet have an API client identity, and so it cannot make authenticated requests to the server. This is where the validation client (named chef\-validator) comes in. When the chef\-client runs, it checks if it has a client key. If the client key does not exist, it then attempts to borrow the validation client\(aqs identity to register itself with the Chef server. In order to register with the Chef server, the validation client\(aqs private key needs to be copied to the host and placed in /etc/chef/validation.pem.
.sp
Once the chef\-client has registered itself with the Chef server, it no longer uses the validation client for anything. It is recommended that you delete the validation client\(aqs private key from the host after the host has registered or use the \fBdelete_validation\fP recipe that can be found in the \fBchef\-client\fP cookbook (\fI\%http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/chef-client\fP).
.sp
The \fBclient\fP sub\-command is used to manage an API client list and their associated RSA public key\-pairs. This allows authentication requests to be made to the Chef server by any entity that uses the Chef Server API, such as the chef\-client and Knife.
.sp
This sub\-command has the following syntax:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
knife client [ARGUMENT] (options)
.ft P
.fi
.SH COMMON OPTIONS

.UNINDENT
.SH BULK DELETE
.sp
The \fBbulk delete\fP argument is used to delete any API client that matches a pattern defined by a regular expression. The regular expression must be within quotes and not be surrounded by forward slashes (/).
.sp
This argument has the following syntax:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
knife client bulk delete REGEX
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This argument does not have any argument\-specific options.
.sp
\fBExamples\fP
.sp
For example:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ knife client bulk delete "^[0\-9]{3}$"
.ft P
.fi
.SH CREATE
.sp
The \fBcreate\fP argument is used to create a new API client. This process will generate an RSA key pair for the named API client. The public key will be stored on the Chef server and the private key will be displayed on STDOUT or written to a named file.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
For the chef\-client, the private key should be copied to the system as /etc/chef/client.pem.
.IP \(bu 2
For Knife, the private key is typically copied to ~/.chef/client_name.pem and referenced in the knife.rb configuration file.
.UNINDENT
.sp
This argument has the following syntax:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
knife client create CLIENT_NAME (options)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This argument has the following options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-a\fP, \fB\-\-admin\fP
Indicates that a client will be created as an admin client. This is required when users of Open Source Chef need to access the API as an administrator. This option only works when used with Open Source Chef and will have no effect when used with Hosted Chef or Private Chef.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBExamples\fP
.sp
For example, to create a Chef Admin client with the name "exampleorg" and save its private key to a file, enter:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ knife client create exampleorg \-a \-f "/etc/chef/client.pem"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
When running the \fBcreate\fP argument on Hosted Chef or Private Chef, be sure to omit the \fB\-a\fP option:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ knife client create exampleorg \-f "/etc/chef/client.pem"
.ft P
.fi
.SH DELETE
.sp
The \fBdelete\fP argument is used to delete a registered API client.
.sp
This argument has the following syntax:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
knife client delete CLIENT_NAME
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This argument does not have any argument\-specific options.
.sp
\fBExamples\fP
.sp
For example, to delete a client with the name "client_foo", enter:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ knife client delete client_foo
.ft P
.fi
.sp
Type \fBY\fP to confirm a deletion.
.SH EDIT
.sp
The \fBedit\fP argument is used to edit the details of a registered API client. When this argument is run, Knife will open $EDITOR to enable editing of the \fBadmin\fP attribute. (None of the other attributes should be changed using this argument.) When finished, Knife will update the Chef server with those changes.
.sp
This argument has the following syntax:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
knife client edit CLIENT_NAME
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This argument does not have any argument\-specific options.
.sp
\fBExamples\fP
.sp
For example, to edit a client with the name "exampleorg", enter:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ knife client edit exampleorg
.ft P
.fi
.SH LIST
.sp
The \fBlist\fP argument is used to view a list of registered API client.
.sp
This argument has the following syntax:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
knife client list (options)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This argument has the following options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-w\fP, \fB\-\-with\-uri\fP
Indicates that the corresponding URIs will be shown.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBExamples\fP
.sp
To verify the API client list for the Chef server, enter:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ knife client list
.ft P
.fi
.sp
to return something similar to:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
exampleorg
i\-12345678
rs\-123456
.ft P
.fi
.sp
To verify that an API client can authenticate to the
Chef server correctly, try getting a list of clients using \fB\-u\fP and \fB\-k\fP options to specify its name and private key:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ knife client list \-u ORGNAME \-k .chef/ORGNAME.pem
.ft P
.fi
.SH REREGISTER
.sp
The \fBreregister\fP argument is used to regenerate an RSA key pair for an API client. The public key will be stored on the Chef server and the private key will be displayed on STDOUT or written to a named file.
.IP Note
Running this argument will invalidate the previous RSA key pair, making it unusable during authentication to the Chef server.
.RE
.sp
This argument has the following syntax:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
knife client reregister CLIENT_NAME (options)
.ft P
.fi
.sp
This argument has the following options:
.INDENT 0.0

.B \fB\-f FILE_NAME\fP, \fB\-\-file FILE_NAME\fP
Indicates that the private key will be saved to a specified file name.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBExamples\fP
.sp

.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ knife client regenerate testclient \-f rsa_key
.ft P
.fi
.SH SHOW
.sp

.B \fB\-a ATTR\fP, \fB\-\-attribute ATTR\fP
Indicates that only a single attribute is shown, as defined by the \fBATTR\fP value.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBExamples\fP
.sp
For example, to view a client named "testclient", enter:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ knife client show testclient
.ft P
.fi
.sp
to return something like:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
admin:       false
chef_type:   client
json_class:  Chef::ApiClient
name:        testclient
public_key:
