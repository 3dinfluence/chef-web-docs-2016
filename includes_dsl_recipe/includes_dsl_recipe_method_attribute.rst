Use the ``attribute?`` method to ensure that certain actions only execute in the presence of a particular attribute. The ``attribute?`` method will return true if one of the listed attributes matches an attribute that is detected by |ohai| during every |chef client| run. 

The syntax for the ``attribute?`` method is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   attribute?("name_of_attribute")

For example: 

.. code-block:: ruby

   if node.attribute?('ipaddress')
     # the node has an ipaddress
   end
