.. The contents of this file are included in multiple topics.
.. This file describes a command or a sub-command for opscode-expander.
.. This file should not be changed in a way that hinders its ability to appear in multiple documentation sets.

For example, to view the aggregate queue backlog, enter the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ cd /opt/opscode/embedded/service/opscode-expander/
     export PATH=$PATH:/opt/opscode/bin:/opt/opscode/embedded/bin
     bin/opscode-expanderctl queue-depth

to return something similar to:

.. code-block:: bash

       total messages:       0
       average queue depth:  0.0
       max queue depth:      0
       min queue depth:      0
