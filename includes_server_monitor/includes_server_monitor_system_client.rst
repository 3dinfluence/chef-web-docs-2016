If a client makes an HTTP request to the server that returns a non-specific error message, this is typically an issue with the |service chef| or |service erchef| services. View the full error message for these services in their respective log files. The error is most often a stacktrace from the application error. In some cases, the error message will clearly indicate a problem with another service, which can then be investigated further. For non-obvious errors, please contact |company_name| support services.
