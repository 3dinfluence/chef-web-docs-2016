|ohai| is a tool that is used to detect attributes on a node, and then provide these attributes to the |chef client| at the start of every |chef client| run. |ohai| is required by the |chef client| and must be present on a node. (|ohai| is installed on a node as part of the |chef client| install process.)

The types of attributes |ohai| collects include (but are not limited to):

* Platform details
* Network usage
* Memory usage
* CPU data
* Kernel data
* Host names
* Fully qualified domain names
* Other configuration details

Attributes that are collected by |ohai| are automatic attributes, in that these attributes are used by the |chef client| to ensure that these attributes remain unchanged after the |chef client| is done configuring the node.
