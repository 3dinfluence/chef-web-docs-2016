This is the stub for documentation about chef-shell. This used to be Shef.

It has a resource/provider: breakpoint

https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/provider/breakpoint.rb
https://github.com/opscode/chef/blob/master/lib/chef/resource/breakpoint.rb

that should be moved to the includes_resources folder when finished (but only included into the chef-shell docs) ... among other things. Placeholder for now!
