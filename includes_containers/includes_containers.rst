Containers are an approach to virtualization that allow a single operating system to host many working configurations, with each working configuration running as a process that is isolated from all other processes, including even the host operating system. Each container comprises a working configuration---or application---and all of its dependencies that are not already available from the host operating system or from another container that is also running on the host operating system.
