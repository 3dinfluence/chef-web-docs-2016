|chef server oec| supports |windows ad| and |ldap| authentication, which enables users to log in using corporate credentials instead of also having a unique password in |chef server oec|. To set up |windows ad| and/or |ldap|, follow the instructions in the |windows ad| / |ldap| installation section of this guide.

When |windows ad| or |ldap| is enabled, the login page will authenticate users using those credentials.
