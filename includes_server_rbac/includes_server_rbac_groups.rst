A group is used to define access to object types and objects in the |chef server| and also to assign permissions that determine what types of tasks are available to members of that group who are authorized to perform them. Individual users who are members of a group will inherit the permissions assigned to the group. The |chef server oec| server includes the following default groups: |webui group admins|, |webui group clients|, and |webui group users|. For users of hosted |chef server oec|, an additional default group is provided: |webui group billing|.
