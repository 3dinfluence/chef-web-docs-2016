Using multiple organizations within the |chef server| ensures that the same toolset, coding patterns and practices, physical hardware, and product support effort is being applied across the entire company, even when:

* Multiple product groups must be supported---each product group can have its own security requirements, schedule, and goals
* Updates occur on different schedules---the nodes in one organization are managed completely independently from the nodes in another
* Individual teams have competing needs for object and object types---data bags, environments, roles, and cookbooks are unique to each organization, even if they share the same name
