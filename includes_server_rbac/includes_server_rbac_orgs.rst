An organization is the top-level entity for role-based access control in the |chef server|. Each organization contains the default groups (|webui group admins|, |webui group clients|, and |webui group users|, plus |webui group billing| for the hosted |chef server|), at least one user and at least one node (on which the |chef client| is installed). The |chef server| supports multiple organizations. The |chef server| includes a single default organization that is defined during setup. Additional organizations can be created after the initial setup and configuration of the |chef server|.
