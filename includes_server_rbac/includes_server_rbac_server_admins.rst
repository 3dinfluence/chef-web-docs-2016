The |webui group server_admins| group is a global group that grants its members permission to create, read, update, and delete user accounts, with the exception of superuser accounts. The |webui group server_admins| group is useful for users who are responsible for day-to-day administration of the |chef server|, especially user management via the ``knife user`` subcommand. Before members can be added to the |webui group server_admins| group, they must already have a user account on the |chef server|.
