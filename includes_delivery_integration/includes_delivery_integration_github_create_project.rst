Before you begin you will need an existing |github| repo with at least one commit and also you have to grant admin rights to the |chef delivery| account connected to |github|.

#. Open your organization page in the |chef delivery| web UI and click the Add icon (plus sign) for **Add a New Project**. A text area opens.
#. Select the **Github** option for **Source Code Provider** and enter the **Github Organization Name**, **Github Project Name** (your project name should match your GitHub repo name), and the branch you wish to use as your primary pipeline.
#. Click **Save & Close**.
