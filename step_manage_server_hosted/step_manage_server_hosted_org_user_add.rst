#. Ask them to sign up for a |chef hosted| account and give you their username.

#. Log on to the **Management Console** and select an organization to use if you are associated with multiple organizations.

#. Click the **Users** tab in the main navigation menu.

#. Click **Invite** in the sub-menu.

#. Enter the users you want to associate to the organization shown, separated by comma if there is more than one. And then click on the **Invite** button:

   Afterwards you should see this user appear in the **Pending User Invites** section of the **Users** tab.

#. The user will need to click on organizations in the upper right hand corner. Then they can click on the **Accept** link next to the invite at the bottom of the page:
