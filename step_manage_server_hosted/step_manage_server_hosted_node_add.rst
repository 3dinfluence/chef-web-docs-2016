The node create page lists all available recipes and roles in the organization, and allows you to include these in the run list of the node you are creating. There is also a JSON editor for editing, adding and removing the node's attributes.

A node is also created the first time you run chef-client, or when you use Knife Bootstrap commands.

In order to create a node through the Management Console:

#. Login to the Hosted Chef Management Console and select an organization.

#. Click on the Nodes tab.

#. Click Create on the sub navigation bar.

#. Edit the node, further information is in the next section. Click Create Node to save the new node when you are done.

Note: You need create permissions on the global nodes level to create a node.
