.. This is an included how-to. 

You can search through the Search Indexes including Environments, Clients, Roles, Nodes, or Data Bags by using the "attribute:value" syntax on the search page in the Management Console. More information about this syntax can be found in the Search article.

For example, if you want to search a client whose name is "foobar":

#. Log on to the **Management Console** and select an organization to use if you are associated with multiple organizations.

#. Click on the **Search** tab on the main navigation menu.

#. In the text box under the "Client" search index, enter "clientname:foobar" and click on the Search client button.

   The results will look like this if there is a client named "foobar":

   If you leave the search box empty, it returns all the objects of that type. Searching for Environments, Data Bags, Nodes, and Roles work the same way.
