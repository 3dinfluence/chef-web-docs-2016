.. This is an included how-to. 

.. note:: You need create permissions on the global clients level to create a client.

New clients are typically created by the |chef client| when it first connects to |chef hosted|, so there is no need in that case to manually create a new client.

If you need to manually create one, you can follow these steps:

#. Log in to the **Management Console** and select an organization to use if you are associated with multiple organizations.

#. Select the **Clients** tab

#. Click on the **Create** sub-menu

#. Enter a name for the client and press **Create Client**. A link to your client's private key will be shown. |company_name| does not store your private keys, so be sure to download and save the private key. You can generate a new private key if you lose it, however.
