.. This is an included how-to. 

To edit role |json| data:

#. Click on the plus sign next to "json" and select "default" or "override" from the tree on the left, depending on the type of attribute you want to create. If you're unsure, you should select "default" unless you are trying to override a default attribute that is already set in the node or in a recipe.

#. Click on the **Editor** tab on the right.

#. Push the green add button under the **Editor** tab: 

#. Select a type of attribute from the drop down box. If you are unsure, you most likely want "string" if the value is text, or "number" if the value is a number.

#. Enter a name as the key and a body as the value and click **Add Attribute**. The following figure shows the **Default and Override Attributes** tree and the JSON editor.
