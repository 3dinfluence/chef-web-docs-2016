.. This is an included how-to. 

.. note:: You need update permissions on the parent data bag in order to edit a data bag item within it.

To edit a data bag item in a specific data bag:

#. Log on to the **Management Console** and select an organization to use if you are associated with multiple organizations.

#. Click **Databags** on the main navigation menu.

#. Click the **Edit** link next to the name of the data bag item you want to edit.

#. Click **Edit Databag Item** on the sub navigation bar. You will see a page with a JSON editor.

#. Click the **Source** tab in the JSON editor to edit the data bag item directly, or use the tree view on the left and the Editor tab to add and edit keys and values. You should not delete the "id" key as this contains the name of the data bag item. More information on using the Editor and Source tabs can be found in the sections above.
