.. This is an included how-to. 



Note: Roles are used here as an example, but it works the same way for Nodes, Cookbooks, Databags, Clients, and Groups. The permissions on Databag Items are inherited from their parent Databags.

In order to view and update the global level permissions on an object type (Roles in this case):

#. Log on to the **Management Console** and select an organization to use if you are associated with multiple organizations.

#. Click the **Roles** tab on the main navigation menu.

#. Click the **Permissions** tab on the sub-navigation menu, select or deselect the permission checkboxes as appropriate, and click **Update Permissions**.
