.. This is an included how-to. 

From the **Manage Account** page of the **Management Console** you can update the details about your organization. The only information you can change about your organization is the **Organization Full Name** field. This field represents the formal way in which somebody would address your organization. To change your **Organization Full Name**:

#. Log into http://manage.opscode.com,
#. Click on **Organizations** in the upper right-hand corner,
#. Click on **Manage Account** for the relevant organization,
#. The **Management Console** will redirect you to the **Account Management Tool**.

From this tool, you can also switch between organization:

#. Click on either **View/Edit Plan** or **Billing Details** depending on the task (see below).
#. Organizations that you are a member of will appear in a drop down near the top of the page.
#. You will need to be a member of the ``billing-admins`` group to view or modify the billing or plan information. If you are not a ``billing-admin`` you will see this error instead:

   To become a ``billing-admin``, a member of the ``billing-admins`` group must add your user to the group.
