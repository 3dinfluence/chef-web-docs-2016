   For instance, to view nodes in the environment you could click on the **Node** tab after selecting environment from the drop down. To view data for all environments select **None** from the drop down. This can also get set by clicking on the **Select** link next to an environment on the **Environments** tab.

Note: You need read permissions on the environment to view it.
