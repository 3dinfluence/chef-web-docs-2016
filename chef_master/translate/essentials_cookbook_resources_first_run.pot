msgid "The ideal way to achieve idempotence when using a non-idempotent resource is to inspect the state of the node and condition the resource on that state using the ``not_if`` or ``only_if`` conditional execution resource attributes. However, it may be difficult or impossible to correctly inspect the state of the system, or you may never want to run the command again, even if the system's state is incorrect."
