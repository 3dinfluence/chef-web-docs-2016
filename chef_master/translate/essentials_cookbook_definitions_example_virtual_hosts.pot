msgid "Two applications need to be deployed and run on a single node under the same domain and sub-domain. A |ruby on rails| application will reside as the main application at ``example.com`` and a |wordpress| application will reside at ``blog.example.com``. The domain is running |apache 2| as the web server. The domain is expected to grow, but for now only two run_list resources are created, with the appropriate roles added to them. At some point in the future, when a new sub-domain is required, a new run_list resource would also be created."

msgid "When |chef| processes a recipe that contains this definition, it will find the ``web_app`` resource and will attempt to recognize it as a resource. Assuming that the |opscode| |apache 2| cookbook is available, the resources contained within that cookbook will be found and loaded, replacing the definition."
