msgid "Once the workstation is configured, it can be used to install |chef| on one (or more) nodes across the organization using a |knife| bootstrap operation. The ``knife bootstrap`` command is used to |ssh| into the target machine, and then do what is needed to allow the |chef client| to run on the node. It will install the |chef exec client| executable (if necessary), generate keys, and register the node with the |chef server|. The bootstrap operation requires the IP address or |fully qualified domain name| of the target system, the |ssh| credentials (username, password or identity file) for an account that has root access to the node, and (if the operating system is not |ubuntu|, which is the default distribution used by ``knife bootstrap``) the operating system running on the target system."
