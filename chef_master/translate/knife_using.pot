msgid "|knife| runs from a management workstation and sits in-between a |chef server| and an organization's infrastructure. |knife| interacts with a |chef server| by using the same REST API that is used by a |chef client|. Role-based authentication controls (RBAC) can be used to authorize changes when |knife| is run with |chef hosted| or |chef private|. |knife| is configured during workstation setup, but subsequent modifications can be made using the |knife rb| configuration file."

msgid "|knife| includes a series of sub-commands that are built around a common set of verbs: ``create``, ``delete``, ``download``, ``list``, ``show``, and ``upload``. These sub-commands allow a user of |knife| to build commands that interact with any object stored in the |chef| repository or stored on the |chef server|.

The sub-commands specify the desired action with the verb, and then the object by specifying the directory in which that object resides: ``cookbooks/``, ``data_bags/``, ``environments/``, and ``roles/``.
