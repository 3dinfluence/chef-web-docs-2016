msgid "|knife| includes a series of sub-commands that are built around a common set of verbs: ``create``, ``delete``, ``download``, ``list``, ``show``, and ``upload``. These sub-commands allow a user of |knife| to build commands that interact with any object stored in the |chef| repository or stored on the |chef server|.
