When ``use_inline_resources`` is added to the file, the code in the lightweight provider's ``action`` block will execute as part of a self-contained |chef| run. If any embedded lightweight resources are updated, the top-level lightweight resource is marked as updated and notifications set for the top-level resource will be triggered normally."
