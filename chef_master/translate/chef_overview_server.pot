msgid "The |chef server| acts as a hub, ensuring that the right cookbooks are used, that the right policies are applied, that all of the node objects are up-to-date, and that all of the nodes that will be maintained are registered and known to the |chef server|. The |chef server| distributes configuration details (such as recipes, templates, and file distributions) to every node within the organization. |chef| then does as much of the configuration work as possible on the nodes themselves (and not on the |chef server|). This scalable approach distributes the configuration effort throughout the organization."

msgid "|chef hosted| is a version of a |chef server| that is hosted by |opscode|. |chef hosted| is cloud-based, scalable, and available (24x7/365), with resource-based access control. |chef hosted| has all of the automation capabilities of |chef|, but without requiring it to be set up and managed from behind the firewall."

# a2c06cf625754c9394c4ddb26524d276
msgid "|chef hosted| is based on the idea that an infrastructure management tool should be built around a collection of API primitives. By using an API to talk to a cloud provider (such as |amazon vpc|, |windows azure|, or |rackspace|), it allows the freedom to think of those primitives as building blocks. |chef| only needs to know about the desired state, how it should get there, and what the proper functionality of that desired state should be."

# a1317615988a4ea9bd7235086759c635
msgid "|chef private| evolved out of a need for customers to have the same functionality provided by |chef hosted|, but located behind the firewall. |chef private| is the same as |chef hosted| in every other way. |chef hosted| is the largest |chef private| deployment in the world."

msgid "|chef open server| is an open source version of the |chef server| that contains much of the same functionality as |chef hosted|, but requires that each instance be configured and managed locally, including performing data migrations, applying updates to the |chef open server| server, and ensuring that the |chef open server| server scales as the local infrastructure it is supporting grows. |chef open server| includes support from the |chef| community, but does not include support directly from |opscode|."
