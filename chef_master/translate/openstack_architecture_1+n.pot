msgid "The **Single Controller + N Compute** (aka **1+N**) configuration refers to a single controller and variable number of nodes. This is suitable for relatively small deployments, such as those with fewer than twenty nodes. The size of the deployment depends on the nature of the workload. Compute nodes should typically be given more substantial hardware than the controller node."
