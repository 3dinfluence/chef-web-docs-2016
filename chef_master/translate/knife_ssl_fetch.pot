msgid "Use the |subcommand knife ssl_fetch| subcommand to copy |ssl| certificates from an HTTPS server to the ``trusted_certs_dir`` directory that is used by |knife| and the |chef client| to store trusted |ssl| certificates. When these certificates match the hostname of the remote server, running ``knife ssl fetch`` is the only step required to verify a remote server that is accessed by either |knife| or the |chef client|."

msgid "It is the user's responsibility to verify the authenticity of every |ssl| certificate before downloading it to the |path trusted_certs| directory. |knife| will use any certificate in that directory as if it is a 100% trusted and authentic |ssl| certificate. |knife| will not be able to determine if any certificate in this directory has been tampered with, is forged, malicious, or otherwise harmful. Therefore it is essential that users take the proper steps before downloading certificates into this directory."
