msgid "An environment is a way to map an organization's real-life workflow to what can be configured and managed when using |chef server|. Every organization begins with a single environment called the ``_default`` environment, which cannot be modified (or deleted). Additional environments can be created to reflect each organization's patterns and workflow. For example, creating ``production``, ``staging``, ``testing``, and ``development`` environments. Generally, an environment is also associated with one (or more) cookbook versions."

If this is the case, then creating different items for each environment may be a simple approach to providing per-environment values within a data bag. However, this approach is more time-consuming and may not scale to very large environments or when the data must be stored in many data bag items."
