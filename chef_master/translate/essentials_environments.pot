msgid "An environment is a way to map an organization's real-life workflow to what can be configured and managed when using |chef server|. Every |chef| organization begins with a single environment called the ``_default`` environment, which cannot be modified (or deleted). Additional environments can be created, such as production, staging, testing, and development. Generally, an environment is also associated with one (or more) cookbook versions."

If this is the case, then creating different items for each environment may be a simple approach to providing per-environment values within a data bag. However, this approach is more time-consuming and may not scale to very large environments or when the data must be stored in many data bag items."
