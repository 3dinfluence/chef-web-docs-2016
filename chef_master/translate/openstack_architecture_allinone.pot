msgid "**All-in-One Compute** configurations are appropriate for small scale deployments like proof of concept projects, dedicated fenced development environments, or when the host will be a virtual machine. This machine need not be large, but it must be sufficient to launch a few virtual instances, assuming those instances are only used for testing purposes. This configuration is a good way to familiarize yourself with the basics of |chef openstack|."
