The backup script will create a snapshot logical volume in unused space in the ``/opscode`` volume group. After the snapshot is created, the backup script will attempt to mount the snapshot logical volume, after which the snapshot will stay mounted for 24 hours. Upon the next |cron| job run, the backup script will attempt to unmount, destroy the snapshot, and then repeat the sequence."
