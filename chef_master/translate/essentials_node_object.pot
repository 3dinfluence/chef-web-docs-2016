msgid "For |chef|, two important aspects of nodes are groups of attributes and run-lists. An attribute is a specific piece of data about the node, such as a network interface, a file system, the number of clients a service running on a node is capable of accepting, and so on. A run-list is an ordered list of recipes and/or roles that are run in an exact order. The run-list and node attributes comprise the node object, which is a |json| file that is stored on the |chef server|. The |chef client| gets a copy of the node object from the |chef server| during each |chef| run and places an updated copy on the |chef server| at the end of each |chef| run."

msgid "An attribute is a specific detail about a node, such as an IP address, a host name, a desired application setting, a list of loaded kernel modules, the version(s) of available programming languages that are available, and so on. Attributes can be maintained in a variety of ways, such as by re-loading a cookbook (that contains new attributes), by using |knife|, or by using JSON data. During a |chef| run, the |chef client| gets attributes from |ohai|, the node object on the |chef server|, roles, recipes, and environments. These attributes are compared and then updated based on attribute precedence rules that are defined for each attribute. At the end of a |chef| run, the |chef client| will save the node object (and all of its attributes) to the |chef server| so they can be indexed for search."
