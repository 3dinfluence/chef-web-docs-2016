msgid "For the |chef client|, two important aspects of nodes are groups of attributes and run-lists. An attribute is a specific piece of data about the node, such as a network interface, a file system, the number of clients a service running on a node is capable of accepting, and so on. A run-list is an ordered list of recipes and/or roles that are run in an exact order. The node object consists of the run-list and node attributes, which is a |json| file that is stored on the |chef server|. The |chef client| gets a copy of the node object from the |chef server| during each |chef client| run and places an updated copy on the |chef server| at the end of each |chef client| run."

msgid "Another (much less common) approach is to set a value only if an attribute has no value. This can be done by using the ``_unless`` variants of the attribute priority methods: ``default_unless``, ``set_unless``, and ``override_unless``. These variants should be used carefully because when they are used, the attributes applied to nodes may become out of sync with the values in the cookbooks as these cookbooks are updated. This approach can create situations where two otherwise identical nodes end up having slightly different configurations. This approach can also be a challenge to debug, so it is recommended to use the ``_unless`` variants carefully (and only when they are really necessary)."
