msgid "|role description| Each role consists of zero (or more) attributes and a run list. Each node can have zero (or more) roles assigned to it. When a role is run against a node, the configuration details of that node are compared against the attributes of the role, and then the contents of that role's run list are applied to the node's configuration details. When a |chef client| runs, it merges its own attributes and run lists with those contained within each assigned role."
