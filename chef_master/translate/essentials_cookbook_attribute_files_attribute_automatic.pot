msgid "An automatic attribute is data that must be understood, but not modified. For example, the IP address of a node, a host name, or the number of loaded kernel modules. When |chef| makes changes to a system during a |chef| run, automatic attributes are used to ensure that |chef| does not make changes to the larger environment on which a node is running. An automatic attribute always has the highest attribute precedence. Automatic attributes are saved to the |chef server| where they are indexed for search. Automatic attributes are detected by |ohai| before every |chef| run."
