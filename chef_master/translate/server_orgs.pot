msgid "The |chef server| uses role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to objects---nodes, environments, roles, data bags, cookbooks, and so on. This ensures that only authorized user and/or |chef client| requests to the |chef server| are allowed. Access to objects on the |chef server| is fine-grained, allowing access to be defined by object type, object, group, user, and organization. The |chef server| uses permissions to define how a user may interact with an object, after they have been authorized to do so."
