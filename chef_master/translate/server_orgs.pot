This ensures that only authorized user and/or |chef client| requests to the |chef server| are allowed. Access to objects on the |chef server| is fine-grained, allowing access to be defined by object type, object, group, user, and organization. The |chef server| uses permissions to define how a user may interact with an object, after they have been authorized to do so."
