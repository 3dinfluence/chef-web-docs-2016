msgid "A `resource <http://docs.getchef.com/resource.html>`_ defines the desired state for a single configuration item present on a node that is under management by |chef|. A resource collection---one (or more) individual resources---defines the desired state for the entire node. During every `chef-client run <http://docs.getchef.com/essentials_nodes_chef_run.html>`_, the current state of each resource is tested, after which the |chef client| will take any steps that are necessary to repair the node and bring it back into the desired state."

msgid "Use the |resource breakpoint| resource to add breakpoints to recipes. Run the |chef client| in |chef shell| mode, and then use those breakpoints to debug recipes. Breakpoints are ignored by the |chef client| during an actual |chef client| run. That said, breakpoints are typically used to debug recipes only when running them in a non-production environment, after which they are removed from those recipes before the parent cookbook is uploaded to the |chef server|."
