msgid "The |chef server| acts as a hub for configuration data. The |chef server| stores cookbooks, the policies that are applied to cookbooks, and metadata that describes each registered node in the infrastructure. Nodes use the |chef client| to ask the |chef server| for configuration details, such as recipes, templates, and file distributions. The |chef client| then does as much of the configuration work as possible on the nodes themselves (and not on the |chef server|). This scalable approach distributes the configuration effort throughout the organization."

This version of |chef| can scale to the size of any enterprise and is often referred to as |erchef|."
