When a cookbook is loaded during a |chef client| run, these attributes are compared to the attributes that are already present on the node.

For each cookbook, attributes in the ``default.rb`` file are loaded first, and then additional attribute files (if present) are loaded in lexical sort order. When the cookbook attributes take precedence over the default attributes, the |chef client| will apply those new settings and values during the |chef client| run on the node."
