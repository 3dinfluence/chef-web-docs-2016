When a cookbook is loaded during a |chef client| run, these attributes are compared to the attributes that are already present on the node. Attributes that are defined in attribute files are first loaded according to cookbook order. For each cookbook, attributes in the ``default.rb`` file are loaded first, and then additional attribute files (if present) are loaded in lexical sort order. When the cookbook attributes take precedence over the default attributes, the |chef client| will apply those new settings and values during the |chef client| run on the node."
