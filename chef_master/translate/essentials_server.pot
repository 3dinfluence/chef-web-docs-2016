msgid "The |chef server| acts as a hub, ensuring that the right cookbooks are used, that the right policies are applied, that all of the node objects are up-to-date, and that all of the nodes that will be maintained are registered and known to the |chef server|. The |chef server| distributes configuration details (such as recipes, templates, and file distributions) to every node within the organization. |chef| then does as much of the configuration work as possible on the nodes themselves (and not on the |chef server|). This scalable approach distributes the configuration effort throughout the organization."

msgid "|chef hosted| is a version of a |chef server| that is hosted by |opscode|. |chef hosted| is cloud-based, scalable, and available (24x7/365), with resource-based access control. |chef hosted| has all of the automation capabilities of |chef|, but without requiring it to be set up and managed from behind the firewall."

# a19fa1833ee84bfa8b4c8a2c7c2ab787
msgid "|chef hosted| evolved out of a need for an infrastructure management tool to be built around the notion of API primitives. By using an API to talk to a cloud provider (such as |amazon vpc|, |windows azure|, or |rackspace|), it allows the freedom to think of those primitives as building blocks. |chef hosted| evolved out of this idea. |chef| only needs to know about the desired state, how it should get there, and what the proper functionality of that desired state should be."

msgid "|chef private| evolved out of a need for customers to have the same functionality provided by |chef hosted|, but located within the organization's firewall. |chef private| is the same as |chef hosted|. |chef hosted| is the largest |chef private| deployment in the world."

msgid "|chef open server| is an open source version of the |chef server| that contains much of the same functionality as |chef hosted|, but requires that each instance be configured and managed locally, including performing data migrations, applying updates to the |chef open server| server, and ensuring that the |chef open server| server scales as the local infrastructure it is supporting grows. |chef open server| includes support from the |chef| community, but does not include support directly from |opscode|."

msgid "Policy settings can be used to map the capabilities of |chef| to business and operational requirements, such as process and workflow. Roles define server types, such as \"web server\" or \"database server\". Environments define process, such as \"dev\", \"staging\", or \"production\". Certain types of data, such as passwords, user account data, and other sensitive items can be placed in data bags, which are located in a secure sub-area of |chef| that can only be accessed by nodes that have the correct |ssl| certificates."
