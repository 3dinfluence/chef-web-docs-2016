msgid "An attribute can be defined in a cookbook (or a recipe) and then used to override the default settings on a node. When a cookbook is loaded during a |chef| run, these attributes are compared to the attributes that are already present on the node. When the cookbook attributes take precedence over the default attributes, |chef| will apply those new settings and values during the |chef| run on the node."

Node methods (when present) are used to set attribute values on a node. For example, the |apache| cookbook contains the following attribute file (called ``default.rb``):"

An attribute may be unique to a specific node or it can be identical across every node in the organization. Attributes are most commonly set from a cookbook, by using |knife|, or are retrieved by |ohai| from each node prior to every |chef| run. All attributes are indexed for search on the |chef server|.

msgid "One approach is to set attributes at the same precedence level by setting attributes in a cookbook's attribute files, and then also setting the same default attributes (but with different values) using a role. The attributes set in the role will be deep merged on top of the attributes from the attribute file, and the attributes set by the role will take precedence over the attributes specified in the cookbook's attribute files."

msgid "Another (much less common) approach is to set a value only if an attribute has no value. This can be done by using the ``_unless`` variants of the attribute priority methods: ``default_unless``, ``set_unless``, and ``override_unless``. These variants should be used carefully because when they are used, the attributes applied to nodes may become out of sync with the values in the cookbooks as these cookbooks are updated. This approach can create situations where two otherwise identical nodes end up having slightly different configurations. This approach can also be a challenge to debug, so it is recommended to use the ``_unless`` variants carefully (and only when they are really necessary)."
