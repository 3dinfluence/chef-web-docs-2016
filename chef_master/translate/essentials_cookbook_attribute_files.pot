When a cookbook is loaded during a |chef| run, these attributes are compared to the attributes that are already present on the node. When the cookbook attributes take precedence over the default attributes, |chef| will apply those new settings and values during the |chef| run on the node."

This can be done by using the ``_unless`` variants of the attribute priority methods: ``default_unless``, ``set_unless``, and ``override_unless``. These variants should be used carefully because when they are used, the attributes applied to nodes may become out of sync with the values in the cookbooks as these cookbooks are updated. This approach can create situations where two otherwise identical nodes end up having slightly different configurations. This approach can also be a challenge to debug, so it is recommended to use the ``_unless`` variants carefully (and only when they are really necessary)."
