In some cases, the use of the |api chef server| requires more detail, such as when making the request in |ruby| code, with a |knife| plugin, or when using |curl|."

A public key encryption is used for all server types: |chef server oec| (hosted and non-hosted), and |chef server osc|.

The public key is stored on the |chef server|, while the private key is returned to the user for safe keeping.
