Only authenticated requests will be authorized. Most of the time, and especially when using |knife|, the |chef client|, or the |chef server| web interface, the use of the |api chef server| is transparent. In some cases, the use of the |api chef server| requires more detail, such as when making the request in |ruby| code, with a |knife| plugin, or when using |curl|."

msgid "The authentication process ensures the |chef server| responds only to requests made by trusted users. A public key encryption is used for all server types: |chef server oec| (hosted and non-hosted), and |chef server osc|. When a node and/or a workstation is configured to run the |chef client|, both public and private keys are created. The public key is stored on the |chef server|, while the private key is returned to the user for safe keeping. (The private key is a .pem file located in the ``.chef`` directory or in ``/etc/chef``.)"
