msgid "|chef| is a systems and cloud infrastructure automation framework that makes it easy to deploy servers and applications to any physical, virtual, or cloud location, no matter the size of the infrastructure. The |chef client| relies on abstract definitions (known as cookbooks and recipes) that are written in |ruby| and are managed like source code. Each definition describes how a specific part of your infrastructure should be built and managed. The |chef client| then applies those definitions to servers and applications, as specified, resulting in a fully automated infrastructure. When a new node is brought online, the only thing the |chef client| needs to know is which cookbooks and recipes to apply."

Only your team can understand the human problems (skill levels, audit trails, and other internal issues) that are unique to your organization and whether any single technical solution is viable."

It is rare that a single individual knows everything about a very complex problem, let alone knows all of the steps that may be required to solve them. The same is true with tools. |chef| provides help with infrastructure management. And |chef| can help solve very complicated problems. |chef| also has a large community of users who have a lot of experience solving a lot of very complex problems. That community can provide knowledge and support in areas that your organization may not have and (along with |chef|) can help your organization solve any complex problem."
