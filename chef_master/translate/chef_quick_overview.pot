The same is true with tools. |chef| provides help with infrastructure management. And |chef| can help solve very complicated problems. |chef| also has a large community of users who have a lot of experience solving a lot of very complex problems. That community can provide knowledge and support in areas that your organization may not have and (along with |chef|) can help your organization solve any complex problem."
