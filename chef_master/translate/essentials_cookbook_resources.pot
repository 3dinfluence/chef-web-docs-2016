msgid "A resource is a key part of a recipe. A resource defines the actions that can be taken, such as when a package should be installed, whether a service should be enabled or restarted, which groups, users, or groups of users should be created, where to put a collection of files, what the name of a new directory should be, and so on. During a |chef| run, each resource is identified and then associated with a provider. The provider then does the work to complete the action defined by the resource. |chef| ensures that the same actions are taken the same way everywhere and that actions produce the same result every time. A resource is implemented within a recipe using |ruby|."

msgid "A resource represents a piece of the system, its current state, and the action that is needed to move it to a desired state. A provider defines the steps that are required to bring that piece of the system from its current to the desired state. An action is de-coupled from the steps required to complete that action, which means that a provider exists for each of the paths that are required to complete the action. This is important because a single action may require different steps, depending on the platform of the system on which the action is being taken."

msgid "For example, \"install a package\" is a single action. To install a package onto various platforms, the steps required for each of those platforms may be different and may require different providers. On a |redhat| or |centos| machine a provider will use the |redhat yum| package provider to get the package installed and on a |debian| or an |ubuntu| machine, a provider will use the |apt| package installer. One action, two providers, each taking only the steps required to complete that action."
