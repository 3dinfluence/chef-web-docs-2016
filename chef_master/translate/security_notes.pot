In this case, that secure connection was provided via HTTPS using the |open ssl| library. Just like any other sensitive information in your infrastructure, it is possible that this data was compromised by the Heartbleed bug. Since the private key is only transferred once, the chances of this information leaking is much lower than other objects, but that chance is still non-zero."

A compromised server could be the |chef server| or any number of services to which the |chef client| connects, for instance when using the |resource remote_file| resource. In this case, a compromised server would be able to send a Heartbleed request back to the client and get access to 64KB of memory from the client.
