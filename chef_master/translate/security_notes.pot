msgid "By default, the |chef server| generates the private keys for all of the nodes in your infrastructure while the |chef client| installed on each node first registers itself with the |chef server|. This private key is not persisted to the |chef server|, but it is transmitted across the network over a secure connection. In this case, that secure connection was provided via HTTPS using the |open ssl| library. Just like any other sensitive information in your infrastructure, it is possible that this data was compromised by the Heartbleed bug. Since the private key is only transferred once, the chances of this information leaking is much lower than other objects, but that chance is still non-zero."

msgid "Another scenario in which the Heartbleed bug could potentially expose the client private key is when the |chef client| is connected to compromised server. A compromised server could be the |chef server| or any number of services to which the |chef client| connects, for instance when using the |resource remote_file| resource. In this case, a compromised server would be able to send a Heartbleed request back to the client and get access to 64KB of memory from the client. This memory can potentially contain the private key used by the |chef client|."
