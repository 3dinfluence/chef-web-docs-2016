msgid "A lightweight resource and provider is a simple way to implement resource and provider functionality that is not already built-in to |chef|. Once created, the lightweight resource and provider become a |ruby| class within the |chef| environment. A lightweight resource and provider require less coding and are ideal for implementing specific sets of desired functionality quickly."
