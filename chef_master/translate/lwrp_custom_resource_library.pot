msgid "A resource is a key part of a recipe. A resource defines the actions that can be taken, such as when a package should be installed, whether a service should be enabled or restarted, which groups, users, or groups of users should be created, where to put a collection of files, what the name of a new directory should be, and so on. During a |chef client| run, each resource is identified and then associated with a provider. The provider then does the work to complete the action defined by the resource. Each resource is processed in the same order as they appear in a recipe. The |chef client| ensures that the same actions are taken the same way everywhere and that actions produce the same result every time. A resource is implemented within a recipe using |ruby|."

msgid "Where a resource represents a piece of the system (and its desired state), a provider defines the steps that are needed to bring that piece of the system from its current state into the desired state. These steps are de-coupled from the request itself. The request is made in a recipe and is defined by a lightweight resource. The steps are then defined by a lightweight provider."

msgid "A resource can also be defined in ``/libraries`` directory. Some advantages of this approach include more control over how resources behave in the provider, the ability to control the name of the resource directly, and more options available for writing tests. The resources and providers for a library resource, similar to lightweight resources (defined in the ``/resources`` and ``/providers`` folders) typically have a separate file for the resource and the provider, but this is not requirement. The main disadvantage of this approach is that resources defined in the ``/libraries`` directory are not able to leverage the |dsl recipe|. That said, a resource that is defined in the ``/libraries`` directory may leverage core |chef client| resources by using the following syntax:"
