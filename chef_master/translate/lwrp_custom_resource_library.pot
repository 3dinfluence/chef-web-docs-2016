msgid "A resource is a statement of configuration policy. It describes the desired state of an element of your infrastructure, along with the steps needed to bring that item to the desired state. Each resource statement in a |chef| recipe corresponds to a specific part of your infrastructure: a file, a template, a directory, a package, a service, a command to be executed, and so on. Each resource statement includes the resource type (such as ``template``, ``service`` or ``package``), its name, any attributes that specify additional details, and an action that tells the |chef client| how to implement the configuration policy."

msgid "Together, resources describe all the components in your network. Recipes group resources together and describe working configurations. Add recipes to a run-list to describe the desired state for every node to which that run-list is assigned. Cookbooks are collections of recipes and are stored on the |chef server|."

msgid "A resource can also be defined in ``/libraries`` directory. Some advantages of this approach include more control over how resources behave in the provider, the ability to control the name of the resource directly, and more options available for writing tests. The resources and providers for a library resource, similar to lightweight resources (defined in the ``/resources`` and ``/providers`` folders) typically have a separate file for the resource and the provider, but this is not requirement. The main disadvantage of this approach is that resources defined in the ``/libraries`` directory may not use the |dsl recipe|. That said, a resource that is defined in the ``/libraries`` directory may leverage core |chef client| resources by using the following syntax:"

msgid "Otherwise, a resource defined in the ``/libraries`` directory is done using |ruby|, is added to recipes as if it were any other resource, and is processed by the |chef client| in the same way as any other resource. See the ``/libraries`` directory in the `database <https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/database>`_ and `runit <https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/runit>`_ cookbooks for complete examples of how to use this approach when defining a resource."
