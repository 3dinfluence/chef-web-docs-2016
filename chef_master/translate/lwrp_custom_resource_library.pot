msgid "A resource defines the desired state for a single configuration item present on a node that is under management by |chef|. A resource collection---one (or more) individual resources---defines the desired state for the entire node. During every `chef-client run <http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_nodes_chef_run.html>`_, the current state of each resource is tested, after which the |chef client| will take any steps that are necessary to repair the node and bring it back into the desired state."

msgid "For example, a resource can define a package to be installed, whether a service should be enabled, restarted, or both, which groups, users, or groups of users should be created, the location in which a file should be created, the template that is used to create that file, the name of a directory, and so on."

msgid "Where a resource represents a piece of the system (and its desired state), a provider defines the steps that are needed to bring that piece of the system from its current state into the desired state. These steps are de-coupled from the request itself. The request is made in a recipe and is defined by a lightweight resource. The steps are then defined by a lightweight provider."

msgid "A resource can also be defined in ``/libraries`` directory. Some advantages of this approach include more control over how resources behave in the provider, the ability to control the name of the resource directly, and more options available for writing tests. The resources and providers for a library resource, similar to lightweight resources (defined in the ``/resources`` and ``/providers`` folders) typically have a separate file for the resource and the provider, but this is not requirement. The main disadvantage of this approach is that resources defined in the ``/libraries`` directory are not able to leverage the |dsl recipe|. That said, a resource that is defined in the ``/libraries`` directory may leverage core |chef client| resources by using the following syntax:"

msgid "Otherwise, a resource defined in the ``/libraries`` directory is done using |ruby|, is added to recipes as if it were any other resource, and is processed by the |chef client| in the same way as any other resource. See the ``/libraries`` directory in the `database <https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/database>`_ and `runit <https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/runit>`_ cookbooks for complete examples of how to use this approach when defining a resource."
