msgid "A role is a way to define certain patterns and processes that exist across nodes in an organization as belonging to a single job function. Each role consists of zero (or more) attributes and a run-list. Each node can have zero (or more) roles assigned to it. When a role is run against a node, the configuration details of that node are compared against the attributes of the role, and then the contents of that role's run-list are applied to the node's configuration details. When a |chef client| runs, it merges its own attributes and run-lists with those contained within each assigned role."
