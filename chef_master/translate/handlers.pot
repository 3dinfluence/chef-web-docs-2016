The simplest way to distribute and install them is via |rubygems|, though other methods such as |github| or HTTP will also work. Once the handler is installed on the system, enable it in the |client rb| file by requiring it. After the handler is installed, it may require additional configuration. This will vary from handler to handler. If a handler is a very simple handler, it may only require the creation of a new instance. For example, if a handler named ``MyOrg::EmailMe`` is hardcoded for all of the values required to send email, a new instance is required.
