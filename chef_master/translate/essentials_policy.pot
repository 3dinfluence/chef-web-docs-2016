Every organization begins with a single environment called the ``_default`` environment, which cannot be modified (or deleted). Additional environments can be created to reflect each organization's patterns and workflow. For example, creating ``production``, ``staging``, ``testing``, and ``development`` environments. Generally, an environment is also associated with one (or more) cookbook versions."

msgid "A role is a way to define certain patterns and processes that exist across nodes in an organization as belonging to a single job function. Each role consists of zero (or more) attributes and a run list. Each node can have zero (or more) roles assigned to it. When a role is run against a node, the configuration details of that node are compared against the attributes of the role, and then the contents of that role's run list are applied to the node's configuration details. When a |chef client| runs, it merges its own attributes and run lists with those contained within each assigned role."
