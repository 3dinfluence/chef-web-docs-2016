msgid "Policy settings can be used to map the capabilities of |chef| to business and operational requirements, such as process and workflow. Roles define server types, such as \"web server\" or \"database server\". Environments define process, such as \"dev\", \"staging\", or \"production\". Certain types of data, such as passwords, user account data, and other sensitive items can be placed in data bags, which are located in a secure sub-area of |chef| that can only be accessed by nodes that have the correct |ssl| certificates."

When a role is run against a node, the configuration details of that node are compared against the attributes of the role, and then the contents of that role's run list are applied to the node's configuration details. When a |chef client| runs, it merges its own attributes and run lists with those contained within each assigned role."
