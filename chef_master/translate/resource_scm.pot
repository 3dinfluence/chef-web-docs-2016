msgid "A `resource <http://docs.opscode.com/resource.html>`_ is a key part of a `recipe <http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_cookbook_recipes.html>`_ that defines the actions that can be taken against a piece of the system. These actions are identified during each `chef-client run <http://docs.opscode.com/essentials_nodes_chef_run.html>`_ as the resource collection is compiled. Once identified, each resource (in turn) is mapped to a provider, which then configures each piece of the system."
