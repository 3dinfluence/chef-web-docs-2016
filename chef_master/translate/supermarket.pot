These configuration settings are processed when the ``supermarket-ctl reconfigure`` command is run, such as immediately after setting up |supermarket| or after making a change to the underlying configuration settings after the server has been deployed. The |supermarket rb| file is a |ruby| file, which means that conditional statements can be used in the configuration file."
