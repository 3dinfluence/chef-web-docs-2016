msgid "|ruby| is a simple programming language that is easy to read and behaves in a predictable manner. The |chef client| uses |ruby| as its reference language, primarily for authoring cookbooks and defining recipes. It is helpful to learn the |ruby| syntax, but knowing how to program using |ruby| is not a requirement."
