msgid "|ruby| is a simple programming language that is easy to read and behaves in a predictable manner. The |chef client| uses |ruby| as its reference language, primarily for authoring cookbooks and defining recipes. It is helpful to learn the |ruby| syntax, but knowing how to program using |ruby| is not a requirement."

Most of the methods in the |dsl recipe| are used to find specific details about a node, and then (depending on those details) to provide additional instructions to the |chef client|."

These settings are saved as |ruby| files and are stored in the |chef repo|. When these files are uploaded to the |chef server|, they are converted to |json|.
