msgid "|ruby| is a simple programming language that is designed to be easy to read and to behave in a predictable manner. The |chef client| uses |ruby| as its reference language for creating cookbooks and defining recipes, with an extended DSL (domain-specific language) that is used for specific resources. Enough resources are available to support the most common infrastructure automation scenarios natively within |chef|; however, this DSL can also be extended when additional resources and capabilities are required."

These settings are saved as |ruby| files and are stored in the |chef repo|. When these files are uploaded to the |chef server|, they are converted to |json|. Each time the |chef repo| is refreshed, the contents of all domain-specific |ruby| files are re-compiled to |json| and are re-uploaded to the |chef server|."
