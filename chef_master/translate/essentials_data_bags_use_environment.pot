msgid "Values that are stored in a data bag are global to the organization and are available to any environment. There are two main strategies that can be used to store per-environment data within a data bag: by using a top-level key that corresponds to the environment or by using separate items for each environment."

However, this approach is more time-consuming and may not scale to very large environments or when the data must be stored in many data bag items."
