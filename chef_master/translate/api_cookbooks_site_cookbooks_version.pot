msgid "A cookbook version always takes the form x.y.z, where x, y, and z are decimal numbers that are used to represent major (x), minor (y), and patch (z) versions. A two-part version (x.y) is also allowed. When passing a cookbook version using this method, underscores (\"_\") should be used as the separator between versions. For example, a cookbook with a version 1.0.1 would be 1_0_1."
