msgid "By creating and editing files using the |ruby| DSL or JSON, role data can be dynamically generated with the |ruby| DSL. Roles created and edited using files are compatible with all versions of |chef|, including |chef solo|. Roles created and edited using files can be kept in version source control, which also keeps a history of what changed when. When roles are created and edited using files, they should not be managed using |knife| or the |chef manager|, as changes will be overwritten."

msgid "When files are uploaded to a |chef server| from a file and then edited using the |chef manager|, if the file is edited and uploaded again, the changes made in the |chef manager| will be lost. The same is true with |knife|, in that if roles are created and managed using |knife| and then arbitrarily updated uploaded JSON data, that action will overwrite what has been done previously using |knife|. It is strongly recommended to keep to one process and not switch back and forth."
