msgid "Like the technical community as a whole, the |chef| team and community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world, working on every aspect of the mission, including mentorship, teaching and connecting people."

msgid "Diversity is one of our biggest strengths, but it can sometimes lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they're participating within the |chef| community and project. These rules apply equally to founders, mentors, and to those seeking help and guidance."

msgid "This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended---a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we all participate."

msgid "Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions."

# 92b3c14575094b73af1ab22bdb662a73
msgid "Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the |chef| community should be respectful when dealing with other members, but also when dealing with people outside the |chef| community."

msgid "Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for within the |chef| community."

msgid "When we disagree, we try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and the |chef| community is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different."

msgid "The strength of the |chef| community comes from all of the people and their wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes."
