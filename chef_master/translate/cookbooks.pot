Anything that is considered core to most (or even all) nodes in the organization is a good candidate to be managed using a |cookbook type_base| cookbook. A |cookbook type_base| cookbook is often a community cookbook used without modification, but is sometimes a cookbook that is build to address specific organizational requirements. Typically, this cookbook does not have dependencies on any other cookbook."
