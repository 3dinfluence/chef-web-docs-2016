msgid "The |chef server| acts as a hub for configuration data. The |chef server| stores cookbooks, the policies that are applied to nodes, and metadata that describes each registered node that is being managed by the |chef client|. Nodes use the |chef client| to ask the |chef server| for configuration details, such as recipes, templates, and file distributions. The |chef client| then does as much of the configuration work as possible on the nodes themselves (and not on the |chef server|). This scalable approach distributes the configuration effort throughout the organization."

The ``knife bootstrap`` command is used to |ssh| into the target machine, and then do what is needed to allow the |chef client| to run on the node. It will install the |chef client| executable (if necessary), generate keys, and register the node with the |chef server|. The bootstrap operation requires the IP address or |fqdn| of the target system, the |ssh| credentials (username, password or identity file) for an account that has root access to the node, and (if the operating system is not |ubuntu|, which is the default distribution used by ``knife bootstrap``) the operating system running on the target system."
