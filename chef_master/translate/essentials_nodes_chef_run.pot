msgid "The |chef client| gets process configuration data from the |client rb| file on the node, and then gets node configuration data from |ohai|. One important piece of configuration data is the name of the node, which is found in the ``node_name`` attribute in the |client rb| file or is provided by |ohai|. If |ohai| provides the name of a node, it is typically the |fqdn| for the node, which is always unique within an organization."
