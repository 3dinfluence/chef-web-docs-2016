msgid "A \"|chef client| run\" is the term used to describe a series of steps that are taken by the |chef client| when it is configuring a node. The following diagram shows the various stages that occur during the |chef client| run, and then the list below the diagram describes in greater detail each of those stages."

One important piece of configuration data is the name of the node, which is found in the ``node_name`` attribute in the |client rb| file or is provided by |ohai|. If |ohai| provides the name of a node, it is typically the |fqdn| for the node, which is always unique within an organization."
