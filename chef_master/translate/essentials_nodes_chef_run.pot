The name of a node is obtained from the ``node_name`` attribute in the |client rb| file or by |ohai|. If |ohai| obtains the name of a node, it is typically the |fqdn| name of the node (which is always unique within an organization). If this is the first |chef| run for a node, the |chef validator| will be used to generate the RSA private key."
