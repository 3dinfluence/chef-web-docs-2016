msgid "A partial search query allows a search query to be made against specific attribute keys that are stored on the |chef server|. A partial search query can search the same set of objects on the |chef server| as a full search query, including specifying an object index and providing a query that can be matched to the relevant index. While a full search query will return an array of objects that match (each object containing a full set of attributes for the node), a partial search query will return only the values for the attributes that match. One primary benefit of using a partial search query is that it requires less memory and network bandwidth while the |chef client| processes the search results."
