msgid "Hosted |chef server oec| is a version of the |chef server| that is hosted by |company_name|. Hosted |chef server oec| is cloud-based, scalable, and available (24x7/365), with resource-based access control. Hosted |chef server oec| has the same automation capabilities of any |chef server|, but without requiring it to be set up and managed from behind the firewall."

msgid "Hosted |chef server oec| is based on the idea that an infrastructure management tool should be built around a collection of API primitives. By using an API to talk to a cloud provider (such as |amazon vpc|, |windows azure|, or |rackspace|), it allows the freedom to think of those primitives as building blocks. The |chef client| only needs to know about the desired state, how it should get there, and what the proper functionality of that desired state should be."
