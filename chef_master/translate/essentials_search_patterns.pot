msgid "An exact matching search pattern is used to search for a key with a name that exactly matches a search query. If the name of the key contains spaces, quotes must be used in the search pattern to ensure the search query finds the key. The entire query must also be contained within quotes, so as to prevent it from being interpreted by |ruby| or a command shell. The best way to ensure that quotes are used consistently is to quote the entire query using single quotes (' ') and a search pattern with double quotes (\" \")."
