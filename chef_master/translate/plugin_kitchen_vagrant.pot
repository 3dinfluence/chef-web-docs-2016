msgid "kitchen-vagrant is the |kitchen| driver for |vagrant| and the default driver installed and packaged with the |chef dk|. This driver generates a single ``Vagrantfile`` for each |kitchen| instance into a sandboxed directory. Because the ``Vagrantfile`` is written out to disk, |vagrant| requires no knowledge of |kitchen| and requires no additional plugins."
