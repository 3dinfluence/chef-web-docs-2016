msgid "|knife download| It can be used to back up data on the |chef server|, inspect the state of one or more files, or to extract out-of-process changes users may have made to files on the |chef server|, such as if a user made a change that bypassed version source control. This sub-command is often used in conjunction with ``knife diff``, which can be used to see exactly what changes will be downloaded, and then ``knife upload``, which does the opposite of ``knife download``."
