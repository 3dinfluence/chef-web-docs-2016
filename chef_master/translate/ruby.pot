msgid "|chef| uses |ruby| as its reference language. |ruby| is a simple programming language that |chef| uses to define the patterns that are found in resources, recipes, and cookbooks. In many cases, just using these patterns is enough to configure, deploy, and manage nodes across the network. |ruby| is also a powerful and complete programming language. You can use the full power of the |ruby| programming language to make decisions about what should happen to specific resources and recipes or to extend |chef| in any manner that your organization requires."

These settings are saved as |ruby| files and are stored in the |chef repo|. When these files are uploaded to the |chef server|, they are converted to |json|. Each time the |chef repo| is refreshed, the contents of all domain-specific |ruby| files are re-compiled to |json| and are re-uploaded to the |chef server|."
