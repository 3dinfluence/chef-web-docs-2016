msgid "The |dsl recipe| is a |ruby| DSL that is primarily used to declare resources from within a recipe. The |dsl recipe| also helps ensure that recipes interact with nodes (and node properties) in the desired manner. Most of the methods in the |dsl recipe| are used to find a specific parameter and then tell |chef| what action(s) to take, based on whether that parameter is present on a node."
