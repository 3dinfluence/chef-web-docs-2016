msgid "A policy file allows you to specify in a single document the cookbook revisions and recipes that should be applied by the |chef client|. A policy file is uploaded to the |chef server|, where it is associated with a group of nodes. When these nodes are configured by the |chef client|, the |chef client| will make decisions based on settings in the policy file, and will build a run-list based on that information. A policy file may be versioned, and then promoted through deployment stages to safely and reliably deploy new configuration."
