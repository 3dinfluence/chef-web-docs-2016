msgid "A lightweight provider can extend another provider class. This can be done as a ``mixin``, which is then placed in a library under the ``library/`` directory of any cookbook that will use the extended provider class. The lightweight provider is then written to include that library in its implementation so that it has access to the extended core resource."
