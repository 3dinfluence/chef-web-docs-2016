msgid "A handler can be distributed using a specific cookbook that is provided by |opscode| to help facilitate the distribution of custom |chef| handlers. The ``chef_handler`` cookbook exposes a lightweight resource provider that can be used to enable custom handlers from within recipes and is useful when including product-specific handlers in cookbooks. The ``chef_handler`` cookbook can be accessed here: http://community.opscode.com/chef_handler. See the README.md of the ``chef_handler`` cookbook for additional information."
