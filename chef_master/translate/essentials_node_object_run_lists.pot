msgid "A run-list is an ordered list of roles and/or recipes that are run in an exact order. A run-list is always specific to the node on which it runs, though it is possible for many nodes to have run-lists that are similar or even identical. The items within a run-list are maintained using |knife| and are uploaded to the |chef server| and stored as part of the node object for each node. |chef| always configures a node in the exact order specified by its run-list and will never run the same recipe twice."

When a role is run against a node, the configuration details of that node are compared against the attributes of the role, and then the contents of that role's run list are applied to the node's configuration details. When a |chef client| runs, it merges its own attributes and run lists with those contained within each assigned role."
