msgid "The authentication process ensures the |chef server| responds only to requests made by trusted users. Public key encryption is used by the |chef server|. When a node and/or a workstation is configured to run the |chef client|, both public and private keys are created. The public key is stored on the |chef server|, while the private key is returned to the user for safe keeping.
