msgid "The authentication process ensures the |chef server| responds only to requests made by trusted users. Public key encryption is used by the |chef server|. When a node and/or a workstation is configured to run the |chef client|, both public and private keys are created. The public key is stored on the |chef server|, while the private key is returned to the user for safe keeping. (The private key is a .pem file located in the ``.chef`` directory or in ``/etc/chef``.)"
