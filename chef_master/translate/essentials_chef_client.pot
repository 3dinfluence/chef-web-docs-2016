msgid "When a node runs the |chef client| for the first time, it generally does not yet have an |chef api client| identity, and so it cannot make authenticated requests to the server. This is where the validation client---known as the |chef validator|---comes in. When the |chef client| runs, it checks if it has a client key. If the client key does not exist, it then attempts to borrow the identity of the |chef validator| to register itself with the |chef server|. In order to register with the |chef server|, the private key for the |chef validator| needs to be copied to the host and placed in |path chef etc validation|."

msgid "Once the |chef client| has registered itself with the |chef server|, it no longer uses the validation client for anything. It is recommended that you delete the private key for the |chef validator| from the host after the host has registered or use the ``delete_validation`` recipe that can be found in the ``chef-client`` cookbook (https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/chef-client)."

msgid "Signed header authentication is used to validate communications between the |chef server| and any node that is being managed by the |chef server|. An API client manages each authentication request. A public and private key pair is used for the authentication itself. The public key is stored in the database on the |chef server|. The private key is stored locally on each node and is kept separate from node data (typically in the |path chef private key| directory). Each request to the |chef server| by a node must include a request signature in the HTTP headers. This signature is computed from a hash of request content and is encrypted using the private key."
