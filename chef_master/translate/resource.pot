msgid "A resource is a statement of configuration policy. It describes the desired state of an element of your infrastructure, along with the steps needed to bring that item to the desired state. Each resource statement in a |chef| recipe corresponds to a specific part of your infrastructure: a file, a template, a directory, a package, a service, a command to be executed, and so on. Each resource statement includes the resource type (such as ``template``, ``service`` or ``package``), its name, any attributes that specify additional details, and an action that tells the |chef client| how to implement the configuration policy."
