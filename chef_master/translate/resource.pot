Each resource statement includes the resource type (such as ``template``, ``service`` or ``package``), its name, any attributes that specify additional details, and an action that tells the |chef client| how to implement the configuration policy."

By design, the actions available to the |resource user| resource are processed **after** the start of the |chef client| run. This means that attributes added or modified by the |resource user| resource during the |chef client| run must be reloaded before they can be available to the |chef client|. These attributes can be reloaded in two ways: by picking up the values at the start of the (next) |chef client| run or by using the `ohai resource <http://docs.getchef.com/resource_ohai.html>`_ to reload these attributes during the current |chef client| run."
