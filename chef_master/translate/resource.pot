msgid "A resource is a key part of a recipe. A resource defines the actions that can be taken, such as when a package should be installed, whether a service should be enabled or restarted, which groups, users, or groups of users should be created, where to put a collection of files, what the name of a new directory should be, and so on. During a |chef client| run, each resource is identified and then associated with a provider. The provider then does the work to complete the action defined by the resource. Each resource is processed in the same order as they appear in a recipe. The |chef client| ensures that the same actions are taken the same way everywhere and that actions produce the same result every time. A resource is implemented within a recipe using |ruby|."
