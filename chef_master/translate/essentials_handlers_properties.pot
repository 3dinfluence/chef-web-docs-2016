msgid "A handler is a class that inherits from ``Chef::Handler`` and implements the ``report()`` function. A handler may be assigned as a report or an exception handler (even though there is no real difference in the underlying code): a report handler runs when the ``success`` indicator is associated with the event message and an exception handler runs when the ``failed`` indicator is associated with the event message. Before ``report()`` is run, ``run_status`` is initialized by |chef|. ``run_status`` is an instance of ``Chef::RunStatus``, which is a class that keeps track of the status of a |chef| run. ``run_status`` provides the following properties:"
