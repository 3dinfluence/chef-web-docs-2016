msgid "|chef| is a systems and cloud infrastructure automation framework that makes it easy to deploy servers and applications to any physical, virtual, or cloud location, no matter the size of the infrastructure. The |chef client| relies on abstract definitions (known as cookbooks and recipes) that are written in |ruby| and are managed like source code. Each definition describes how a specific part of your infrastructure should be built and managed. The |chef client| then applies those definitions to servers and applications, as specified, resulting in a fully automated infrastructure. When a new node is brought online, the only thing the |chef client| needs to know is which cookbooks and recipes to apply."

msgid "The authentication process ensures the |chef server| responds only to requests made by trusted users. A public key encryption is used for all server types: |chef hosted|, |chef private|, and the open source |chef server|. When a node and/or a workstation is configured to run the |chef client|, both public and private keys are created. The public key is stored on the |chef server|, while the private key is returned to the user for safe keeping. (The private key is a .pem file located in the ``.chef`` directory or in ``/etc/chef``.) The following executables use the |api chef server| when communicating with the |chef server|:"

When the |chef client| starts a |chef client| run, a check is done to see if the client key exists on the node at ``/etc/chef/client.pem``. If the key exists, it is used as part of the authentication request to the |chef server|. If the key does not exist, the |chef client| will use the key assigned to the |chef validator| (``/etc/chef/validation.pem``) to ensure that each node can make an authenticated request to the |chef server| during its first |chef client| run. The key pair used by the |chef validator| is created when the|chef client| is installed on a node, either manually or using a |knife| bootstrap operation. If the |chef validator| is unable to make an authentication request to the |chef server|, the |chef client| run fails."
