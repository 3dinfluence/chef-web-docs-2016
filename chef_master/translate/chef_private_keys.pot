msgid "|chef| is a systems and cloud infrastructure automation framework that makes it easy to deploy servers and applications to any physical, virtual, or cloud location, no matter the size of the infrastructure. |chef| relies on abstract definitions (known as cookbooks and recipes) that are written in |ruby| and are managed like source code. Each definition describes how a specific part of your infrastructure should be built and managed. |chef| then applies those definitions to servers and applications, as specified, resulting in a fully automated infrastructure. When a new node is brought online, the only thing that |chef| needs to know is which cookbooks and recipes to apply."

msgid "The authentication process ensures the |chef server| responds only to requests made by trusted users. |chef| uses public key encryption for all server types: |chef hosted|, |chef private|, and the open source |chef server|. When a node and/or a workstation is configured to run |chef|, both public and private keys are created. The public key is stored on the |chef server|, while the private key is returned to the user for safe keeping. (The private key is a .pem file located in the .chef directory or in /etc/chef.) The following executables use the |api chef server| when communicating with the |chef server|:"

If the key exists, it is used as part of the authentication request to the |chef server|. If the key does not exist, |chef| will use the key assigned to the |chef validator| (``/etc/chef/validation.pem``) to ensure that each node can make an authenticated request to the |chef server| during its first |chef| run. The key pair used by the |chef validator| is created when |chef| is installed on a node, either manually or using a |knife| bootstrap operation. If the |chef validator| is unable to make an authentication request to the |chef server|, the |chef| run fails."
