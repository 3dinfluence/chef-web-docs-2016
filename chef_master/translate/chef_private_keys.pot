The |chef client| is an agent that runs on a node and performs the actual tasks that configure it. The |chef server| is the central repository for all configuration data. The |chef client| and |chef server| communicate with each other. For secure communications, they use a combination of public and private keys that ensures the |chef server| responds only to requests made by the |chef client|."
