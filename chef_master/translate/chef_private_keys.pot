msgid "|chef| is a systems and cloud infrastructure automation framework that makes it easy to deploy servers and applications to any physical, virtual, or cloud location, no matter the size of the infrastructure. The |chef client| relies on abstract definitions (known as cookbooks and recipes) that are written in |ruby| and are managed like source code. Each definition describes how a specific part of your infrastructure should be built and managed. The |chef client| then applies those definitions to servers and applications, as specified, resulting in a fully automated infrastructure. When a new node is brought online, the only thing the |chef client| needs to know is which cookbooks and recipes to apply."

msgid "The authentication process ensures the |chef server| responds only to requests made by trusted users. A public key encryption is used for all server types: |chef server oec| (hosted and non-hosted), and |chef server osc|. When a node and/or a workstation is configured to run the |chef client|, both public and private keys are created. The public key is stored on the |chef server|, while the private key is returned to the user for safe keeping. (The private key is a .pem file located in the ``.chef`` directory or in ``/etc/chef``.) The following executables use the |api chef server| when communicating with the |chef server|:"
