msgid "A cloud-based node is hosted in an external cloud-based service, such as |amazon vpc|, |openstack|, |rackspace|, |google compute engine|, |linode|, or |windows azure|. Plugins are available for |knife| that provide support for external cloud-based services. |knife| can use these plugins to create instances on cloud-based services. Once created, the |chef client| can be used to deploy, configure, and maintain those instances."

In other words, a physical node is any active device attached to a network that can run a |chef client| and also allow that |chef client| to communicate with a |chef server|."
