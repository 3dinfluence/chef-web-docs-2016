msgid "A cloud-based node is hosted in an external cloud-based service, such as |amazon vpc|, |openstack|, |rackspace|, |google compute engine|, |linode|, or |windows azure|. Plugins are available for |knife| that provide support for external cloud-based services. |knife| can use these plugins to create instances on cloud-based services. Once created, the |chef client| can be used to deploy, configure, and maintain those instances."

msgid "A physical node is typically a server or a virtual machine, but it can be any active device attached to a network that is capable of sending, receiving, and forwarding information over a communications channel. In other words, a physical node is any active device attached to a network that can run a |chef client| and also allow that |chef client| to communicate with a |chef server|."

msgid "The name of a node can be obtained from the ``node_name`` attribute in the |client rb| file or by allowing |ohai| to collect this data during the |chef client| run. When |ohai| collects this data during the |chef client| run, it uses the |fqdn| name of the node (which is always unique within an organization) as the name of the node."
