A |chef client| runs on each node. |ohai| is used to collect data about the system so that it is available to the |chef client| during every |chef| run."

Plugins are available for |knife| that provide support for external cloud-based services. |knife| can use these plugins to create instances on cloud-based services. Once created, |chef| can be used to deploy, configure, and maintain those instances."

In other words, a physical node is any active device attached to a network that can run a |chef client| and communicate with a |chef server|."
