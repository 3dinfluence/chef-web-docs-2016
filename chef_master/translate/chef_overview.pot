Each definition describes how a specific part of your infrastructure should be built and managed. |chef| then applies those definitions to servers and applications, as specified, resulting in a fully automated infrastructure. When a new node is brought online, the only thing that |chef| needs to know is which cookbooks and recipes to apply."

msgid "For |chef|, two important aspects of nodes are groups of attributes and run-lists. An attribute is a specific piece of data about the node, such as a network interface, a file system, the number of clients a service running on a node is capable of accepting, and so on. A run-list is an ordered list of recipes and/or roles that are run in an exact order. The node object consists of the run-list and node attributes, which is a |json| file that is stored on the |chef server|. The |chef client| gets a copy of the node object from the |chef server| during each |chef| run and places an updated copy on the |chef server| at the end of each |chef| run."
