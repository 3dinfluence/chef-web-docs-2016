msgid "|chef| is a systems and cloud infrastructure automation framework that makes it easy to deploy servers and applications to any physical, virtual, or cloud location, no matter the size of the infrastructure. The |chef client| relies on abstract definitions (known as cookbooks and recipes) that are written in |ruby| and are managed like source code. Each definition describes how a specific part of your infrastructure should be built and managed. The |chef client| then applies those definitions to servers and applications, as specified, resulting in a fully automated infrastructure. When a new node is brought online, the only thing the |chef client| needs to know is which cookbooks and recipes to apply."

An attribute is a specific piece of data about the node, such as a network interface, a file system, the number of clients a service running on a node is capable of accepting, and so on. A run-list is an ordered list of recipes and/or roles that are run in an exact order. The node object consists of the run-list and node attributes, which is a |json| file that is stored on the |chef server|. The |chef client| gets a copy of the node object from the |chef server| during each |chef client| run and places an updated copy on the |chef server| at the end of each |chef client| run."
