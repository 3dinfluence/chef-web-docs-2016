msgid "A resource is a statement of configuration policy. It describes the desired state of an element of your infrastructure, along with the steps needed to bring that item to the desired state. Each resource statement in a |chef| recipe corresponds to a specific part of your infrastructure: a file, a template, a directory, a package, a service, a command to be executed, and so on. Each resource statement includes the resource type (such as ``template``, ``service`` or ``package``), its name, any attributes that specify additional details, and an action that tells the |chef client| how to implement the configuration policy."

For example, the |resource execute| and |resource script|-based resources are not idempotent because the commands that are executed by these resources are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Most of the time, these resources can be made idempotent by `inspecting the state of the node using guards <http://docs.opscode.com/resource_common.html#guards>`_---``not_if`` and ``only_if``---and then defining the conditions necessary to ensure idempotence for that resource block."
