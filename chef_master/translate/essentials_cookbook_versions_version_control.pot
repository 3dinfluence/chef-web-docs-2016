msgid "Using a branch tracking strategy requires that a branch for each environment exists in the source control and that each cookbook's versioning policy is tracked at the branch level. This approach is relatively simple and lightweight: for development environments that track the latest cookbooks, just bump the version before a cookbook is uploaded for testing. For any cookbooks that require higher levels of version control, |knife| allows cookbooks to be uploaded to specific environments and for cookbooks to be frozen (which prevents others from being able to make changes to that cookbook)."
