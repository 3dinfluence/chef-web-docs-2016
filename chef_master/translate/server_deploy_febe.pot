msgid "The front end servers handle requests from the |chef client| (where the requests are made by the |chef client| as it configures a node), from workstations (where the request is typically in the form of a |knife| command), and by users who log on to the |chef server| web user interface. Load balancing is typically configured for the front end servers by using a combination of hardware (such as |f5| or |netscalar|), |ssl| off-loading, and a round-robin load balancing algorithm."

msgid "The back end servers handle data storage and retrieval. Failover is achieved on the back end servers using a combination of asynchronous block level replication of logical volume managers (|drbd|), a shared virtual IP address, and access to the primary server (via the shared virtual IP address) maintained by |keepalived|."
