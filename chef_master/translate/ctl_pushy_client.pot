msgid "|pushy| is a tool that allows jobs to be run against nodes in an organization independently of a |chef client| run and also without any need for a |chef client| to be present on the target node. A job is an action or a command to be executed against a subset of nodes; the nodes against which a job is are determined by the results of a search query made to the |chef server|. |pushy| is an extension of the |api chef server| that uses a |ruby| client to initiate all connections to the |chef server|. Connections use the same authentication and authorization model as any other request made to the |chef server|. A |knife| plugin is used to initiate job creation and job tracking."
