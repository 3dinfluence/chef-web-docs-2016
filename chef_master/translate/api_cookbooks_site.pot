msgid "The |api cookbooks site| is used to provide access to the cookbooks community hosted at |url opscode_community_cookbooks|. All of the cookbooks in the community are accessible through a RESTful API located at |url api_cookbooks| by using any of the supported endpoints. In most cases, using |knife| and the |subcommand knife site cookbook| sub-command (and any of its arguments) is the recommended method of interacting with these cookbooks, but in some cases, using the |api cookbooks site| directly may make sense."
