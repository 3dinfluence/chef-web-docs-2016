All of the cookbooks in the community are accessible through a REST API located at |url api_cookbooks| by using any of the supported endpoints. In most cases, using |knife| and the |subcommand knife site cookbook| sub-command (and any of its arguments) is the recommended method of interacting with these cookbooks, but in some cases, using the REST API directly may make sense."
