config.rb
=====================================================

.. warning:: The ``config.rb`` file is a replacement for the ``knife.rb`` file, starting with the |chef client| 12.0 release. The ``config.rb`` file has identical settings and behavior to the ``knife.rb`` file. The |chef client| will first look for the presence of the ``config.rb`` file and if it is not found, will look for the ``knife.rb`` file. If you are using the |chef client| 11.x versions in your infrastructure, continue using the ``knife.rb`` file.

A ``config.rb`` file is used to specify |chef repo|-specific configuration details.

* This file is loaded every time this executable is run
* The default location in which the |chef client| expects to find this file is |path knife rb|; use the ``--config`` option from the command line to change this location
* This file is not created by default
* When a ``config.rb`` file is present in this directory, the settings contained within that file will override the default configuration settings

Optional Settings
=====================================================
In addition to the default settings in a ``config.rb`` file, there are other subcommand-specific settings that can be added:

#. A value passed via the command-line
#. A value contained in the ``config.rb`` file
#. The default value

A value passed via the command line will override a value in the ``config.rb`` file; a value in a ``config.rb`` file will override a default value.
