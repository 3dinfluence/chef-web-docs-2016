Each user account on a |chef server oec| server has a private key that allows API access to |chef server oec|. A copy of this key is not stored by |chef server oec|. If this key is misplaced it must be regenerated in order to restore API access. This key can be regenerated from a user's profile page. Only the user for each account can regenerate their private key.
