Cookbooks
-----------------------------------------------------
.. include:: ../../includes_cookbooks/includes_cookbooks.rst

The |chef client| uses |ruby| as its reference language for creating cookbooks and defining recipes, with an extended DSL for specific resources. The |chef client| provides a reasonable set of resources, enough to support many of the most common infrastructure automation scenarios; however, this DSL can also be extended when additional resources and capabilities are required.
