Follow the steps below to use the |omnibus installer| to set up a workstation on a machine running |unix|, |linux|, |mac os x|, or |windows|. When finished, a workstation will be configured to connect to a |chef server| and (optionally) can be configured to act as a |chef client|, used to set up a |chef client| on an external machine (or virtual machine) using a ``knife bootstrap`` operation, and used to manage cookbooks, organization settings (like roles, environments, and data bags).

.. note:: |note install trial for hosted|

The steps for installing |chef| on a machine that runs |linux|, |unix|, or |mac os x| are identical. See the following sections for more information about each step.
