Create Users
=====================================================

A new user account must be created before using |chef server oec|.

.. note:: If your server is in |microsoft ad| or |ldap| mode, signup is unnecessary and users can simply log in to |chef server oec| using their credentials.

#. Visiting the |chef server oec| management console will present users with a **Login** page, which contains a **Sign Up** link.
#. Enter the information on this page, and then click **Submit**.
#. Once the user account is created, download the private key. This key is used for API access to |chef server oec|. |chef server oec| does not keep a copy of this key, so please store it somewhere safe.
