Notes for |chef server osc| Upgrades 
=====================================================

The following sections contain more information about the upgrade process from |chef server osc| to |chef server| version 12, including steps for a manual upgrade. Please consult with |company_name| support about any of these situations.

Background
=====================================================
The following assumptions are made about all upgrades from |chef server osc| version 11.0.0 (or higher) to |chef server| version 12.

* An organization must be created. Add the organization name as the vaue for the ``default_orgname`` setting in the ``chef-server.rb`` file. This will ensure that API requests made to the server prior to the upgrade process can still be made after.

Standalone>>Standalone
-----------------------------------------------------
The only supported upgrade path for a |chef server osc| server to |chef server| version 12 is from a standalone configuration to a standalone configuration.

Backup Server Data
-----------------------------------------------------
Like any migration or upgrade, it's strongly recommended to back up your data before doing any of the migration or upgrade steps. While we don't anticipate any issues with the upgrade process itself, it's better to be safe.

Organization Names
-----------------------------------------------------
The |chef server osc| server does not have the concept of organizations. The |chef server| version 12 upgrade process will require an organization to be created.

After an upgrade, the organization is an endpoint in the |api chef server|. The |api chef server| used by the |chef server osc| server does not contain this endpoint. Needless to say, API requests made to the |chef server| by the |chef client|, |knife|, and so on will fail until the ``/organizations/ORG_NAME`` endpoint isn't defined.

To resolve this API request issue, add the following setting to the |chef server rb| file:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - ``default_orgname``
     - The |api chef server| used by the |chef server osc| server does not have an ``/organizations/ORG_NAME`` endpoint. Use this setting to ensure that migrated |chef server osc| servers are able to connect to the |api chef server|. This value should be the same as the name of the organization that was created during the upgrade from |chef server osc| version 11 to |chef server| version 12, which means it will be identical to the ``ORG_NAME`` part of the ``/organizations`` endpoint in |chef server| version 12. Default value: the name of the organization specified during the upgrade process from |chef server osc| 11 to |chef server| 12.

Validation Keys
-----------------------------------------------------
The |chef server osc| server does not have the concept of organizations. The |chef server| version 12 upgrade process will require an organization to be created.

The |chef server osc| uses a validation key and validation client name to ensure that clients can validate to the |chef server osc| server. In |chef server osc|, this is a generic validation client and key. These two settings in the the |client rb| and/or |knife rb| files specifiy the generic client and key:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - ``validation_client_name``
     - |validation_client_name| 
   * - ``validation_key``
     - |validation_key| Default value: ``/etc/chef/validation.pem``.

In |chef server| version 12, the server supports multiple organizations and each organization has a unique validation client and key. The upgrade process will create a new validation client and key and will associate their names with the newly-created organization.

The ``default_orgname`` setting will ensure that the existing generic validation client and key will work with the newly-created organization. Post-upgrate, there will be TWO validation clients and validation keys. The organization-specific client and key is not required; in some cases, it may be necessary to reset that validation key through the |chef manage| web user interface.

.. note:: The |chef manage| web user interface will not be able to reset the generic validation client and key that was migrated from |chef server osc|.

**Add settings to chef-server.rb**

.. include:: ../../includes_server_security/includes_server_security_ssl_cert_custom_set_value_osc_upgrade_config.rst

Server Data on Disk
-----------------------------------------------------
After the upgrade process, data related to the upgrade process will remain on the system:

* The data for the |chef server osc| server will be located in a temporary directory that was created as part of the upgrade process. This directory will be located at ``/tmp/chef11-server-data[some_random_string]``, unless the ``--chef11-data-dir`` option is used as part of the ``chef-server-ctl upgrade`` command.
* The data that was transformed by the upgrade process to the |chef server| version 12 format will be located in a temporary directory that was created during the upgrade process. This directory will be located at ``/tmp/chef12-server-data[some_random_string]``, unless the ``--chef12-data-dir`` option is used as part of the ``chef-server-ctl upgrade`` command.

To remove this data, post-upgrade, simply delete these directories. The current, default behavior of the upgrade process is to leave this data, in case it's required later.

Multiple Upgrades
-----------------------------------------------------
The upgrade process may be run multiple times, as long as |chef server osc| 11 and |chef server| version 12 are installed on the system. Any subsequent upgrade process will re-create the temporary directories. Because the default behavior is to append a random string to the directory name, the number of temporary directories created is proportional to the number of upgrade processes run, unless identical directory names are specified using the ``--chef11-data-dir`` and ``--chef12-data-dir`` options during each upgrade.

Email Address
-----------------------------------------------------
The |chef server| version 12 server requires that the administrator user provide an email address. During the upgrade process, a default email address (``username@example.com``) is created, where ``username`` is the same user that was specified during the upgrade process. This email address may be changed later, post upgrade via the ``knife user edit`` subcommand or via the |chef manage| web user interface.

Cookbook Uploads
-----------------------------------------------------
Sometimes when uploading cookbooks, a race condition may occur that prevents one (or more) cookbooks from finishing the upload process. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   ......
   Chef Client finished, 32/386 resources updated in 42.23452 seconds
   opscode Reconfigured!

   Failed uploading transformed data to the Chef 12 server 

If this error occurs, re-run the upgrade process, adding the ``--upload-threads`` option set to a value of ``1``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ chef-server-ctl upgrade --upload-threads 1

This option will ensure that only one cookbook is uploaded at a time. This approach will be slower, but will prevent a race condition (and this error) from occuring.




Manual Upgrades
=====================================================
The migration process occurs in three steps: download the existing data from the |chef server osc| server, transform that data into the format required for |chef server| version 12, and then upload that data to the server.

The ``chef-server-ctl upgrade`` command will handle all three of these steps. Each of these three steps may be done individually, if required.

To upgrade to |chef server| 12 from the |chef server osc| server, do the following:

#. Run the following to make sure all services are in a sane state.

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ chef-server-ctl reconfigure

#. Stop the |chef server osc| server:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ chef-server-ctl stop

#. Run |debian dpkg| or |rpm| on the machine to install |chef server| version 12. For |debian dpkg|:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ dpkg -D10 -i /path/to/chef-server-core-<version>.deb

   where ``-D`` enables debugging and ``10`` creates output for each file that is processed during the upgrade. See the man pages for |debian dpkg| for more information about this option.
   
   For |rpm|:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ rpm -Uvh /path/to/chef-server-core-<version>.rpm

   |chef server| 12 is installed to ``/opt/opscode``. (The existing |chef server osc| remains at ``/opt/chef-server``.) From this point, the ``chef-server-ctl`` commands are running against the ``/opt/opscode`` location.


#. Upgrade the machine with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ chef-server-ctl chef12-upgrade-download

   When prompted, confirm that the upgrade process should take place.

   This command will download data from the |chef server osc| server and place it into a temporary directory. See the "Subcommand Reference" section below for information about options that may be used with this command.

#. Upgrade the machine with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ chef-server-ctl chef12-upgrade-data-transform

   This command will create a temporary directory in which |chef server osc| data is transformed into the |chef server| version 12 format. See the "Subcommand Reference" section below for information about options that may be used with this command.

#. Upgrade the machine with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash
      
      $ chef-server-ctl chef12-upgrade-upload

   See the "Subcommand Reference" section below for information about options that may be used with this command.
   
   Before data can be uploaded, an organization must be created. When prompted, enter the organization name, and then a full organization name.

   |name_rules org| For example: ``chef``.

   |name_rules org_full| For example: ``Chef Software, Inc.``.

#. The |chef server| is automatically restarted. A prompt is displayed that contains details about how to remove any temporarily data that was created during the upgrade process.
