Chef Community Code of Conduct
=====================================================

The |chef| community is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the world who work together on every aspect of the mission, including mentorship, teaching, and connecting people.

Diversity is one of our biggest strengths, but sometimes it creates challenges with communication among members of the |chef| community. 

To that end, a few ground rules should help everyone communicate better as they are working with other members of the |chef| community. These rules apply equally to founders, mentors, those who submit new features and pull requests, and to anyone who is seeking help and guidance.

The following list isn't exhaustive; take it in the spirit in which it's intended---a guide to help all of us communicate better in a way that makes it easier for the |chef| community to work together:

* **Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.**
* **Be considerate.**
* **Be respectful.**
* **Be professional.**
* **Be careful in the words that you choose.**
* **When we disagree, let's all work together to understand why.**

The previous list applies to all forms of communication: IRC, the mailing list, the issue tracker, and any other forum that is used by the |chef| community. Please keep in mind that:

* Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others.
* Decisions that you make will often affect others in the |chef| community.
* Disagreements happen, but should not be an excuse for poor behavior and bad manners. When disagreements do happen, let's work together to solve them effectively and in a way that ensures that everyone understands what the disagreement was.
* People may not understand jokes, sarcasm, and oblique references in the same way that you do. So remember that and be kind to the other members of the |chef| community.
* Sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not welcome in the |chef| community.

The strength of the |chef| community comes from all of the people in it, their wide range of backgrounds, and the unique contributions we all make. Let's us keep working together, learning from our mistakes, and making the |chef| community as awesome as it is and can be.
