          #. .. include:: ../../includes_chef_server/includes_chef_server_component_rabbitmq.rst
          #. .. include:: ../../includes_chef_server/includes_chef_server_component_expander.rst

For hosted |chef server oec|, these components are mostly transparent because of the hosted interface for the |chef server|. For |chef server oec| and |chef server osc|, these relationships can be more complex, depending on how the machines on which the |chef server| will run need to be deployed.
