What are the core principles of Chef?
=====================================================

.. include:: ../../includes_chef/includes_chef_why_principles.rst


There are some very important principles behind the design of |chef|:

* **Idempotence** --- The system always returns to the desired state
* **Thick Clients, Thin Server** --- Distribution of data to the |chef client|
* **Order Matters** --- Proper sequence during configuration is important
* **Easy to understand, change, and extend** --- The ability to easily extend the capabilities of |chef|

Why was Chef created?
=====================================================
|opscode| began as a consulting company named HJK Solutions, which built fully automated infrastructure for startups. Everything from installing operating systems to full application development. Over the course of building a dozen or so different startups on the same basic infrastructure timeline (over a one year period), we realized that getting to a place where everyone could have a fully automated infrastructure, regardless of the expertise of their system administrators, was possible. Only a few things stood in the way:

* A fully automated infrastructure is a fully integrated infrastructure. The different components need to be able to communicate with each other. (Your application informs your infrastructure, just like your infrastructure informs your application.)
* Configuration management is the fundamental bedrock of infrastructure automation. For the infrastructure to be fully automated, it must expose configuration management as a service.
* Share the code that builds the infrastructure is difficult; the available tools required a level of specificity that made sharing difficult.
* No other open source tools met the requirements.

We solve these problems by:

* Building a systems integration framework on top of a configuration management system, powered by |ruby| and a simple DSL. This approach makes it easy for beginners.
* Making it possible to easily extend the capabilities of |chef| and by allowing |chef| to take instruction from ad-hoc sources.
* Every decision about |chef| was made with an eye to keeping as much as possible inside of cookbooks, which are sharable chunks of automation that are easily reused and extended.
* Sharing an open source version of |chef| with everyone, creating an outstanding community, with a license that allows everyone to safely integrate |chef| into their environment. |chef| (and |ohai|) are licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0, a liberal, non-copyleft free software license. We maintain Contributor License Agreements, which allows anyone who uses |chef| (or |ohai|) to know they are free from any copyright or patent entanglements. 

The goal is to remove people from the process of building automated infrastructure, as much and as often as possible. |chef| is the first part of a framework that will allow all of us to do that.

How can I help?
-----------------------------------------------------
Join the |chef| community, participate in the discussion going on right now on IRC, sign up for the |chef| mailing Lists, and read the instructions on how to contribute to an |opscode| open source project.

Do I really need to know Ruby?
-----------------------------------------------------
It helps, but its not required. You can learn :doc:`Just Enough Ruby for Chef </just_enough_ruby_for_chef>`.

Can I trust |chef|?
-----------------------------------------------------
Yes, absolutely. |chef| will not do anything to your system that isn't in a recipe. Because |chef| is an open source project, you have full access to the source code.


Who uses Chef?
=====================================================
Lots of companies, ranging from `small startups to the largest companies on the planet <http://www.opscode.com/customers/>`_.

Why the Apache license?
=====================================================
The short version is that we had three broad requirements for the license under which we would release open source software:

* We are an open source company. We make money from our open source software. We wanted a license that allowed us to build a business from the things we created
* We wanted anyone (or any company) whose problems were solved by our software to be able to use it, in any environment they wanted, in whatever way they wanted
* We wanted to build an open and equal community of users. We did not want to reserve any rights for ourselves that we didnâ€™t grant to the all of the other people (and companies) who helped build our software

For more detail, read `the blog post about why we love open source <http://www.opscode.com/blog/2009/08/11/why-we-chose-the-apache-license/>`_.


Comparisons
=====================================================
There are some other applications out there that do things similar to |chef|. We believe that we are different (and better) and that by choosing |chef| you are choosing the best option.

|puppet|
-----------------------------------------------------
|puppet| evolved from |cfengine| and showed potential to be a new kind of configuration management. The original design of |chef| was strongly influenced by our own experiences working with and contributing to the |puppet| project. That said, |chef| does not share any code from |puppet|, and is not a "fork" of the |puppet| project. 

|chef| is different from |puppet| in a number of important ways:

* |chef| uses |ruby| as the configuration language, as opposed to a custom DSL
* |chef| is designed from the ground up to integrate with other tools, or to make that integration as simple as possible. |chef| is not the canonical representation of your infrastructure. It is a service that exposes data about the state of your infrastructure
* |chef| applies resources in the order they are specified in recipes. There is no dependency management. This means multiple |chef| runs will always apply the resources under management in the same order, every time
* |chef| resources have actions, which can be signaled
* Resources can appear more than once in |chef|, and they inherit the attributes of the earlier resource. In other words, you can tell |apache| to start and stop in a recipe by specifying the resource twice, with the second one only changing the action attribute


As |chef| grows, the services we expose will likely be integrated with |puppet| as well. There is more than one way to do it.

|cfengine|
-----------------------------------------------------
|cfengine| and |chef| aren't very similar at all, outside of both applications embracing the concept of Single Copy Nirvana.
