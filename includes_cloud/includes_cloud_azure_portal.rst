|azure| is a cloud hosting platform from |microsoft| that provides virtual machines. The |azure portal_production| (|url azure_production|) can boostrap |windows|-based virtual machines that are already provisioned with the |chef client| running as a background service. Once provisioned, these virtual machines are ready to be managed by |chef|.

To use the |chef| integration with the |azure portal|, all you need is a |chef server|. You can `choose a Chef version <http://www.chef.io/chef/choose-your-version/>`_, or deploy a |chef server| via the |azure marketplace|.
