While the |amazon ami| for |chef server| is being provisioned, download and install the `Chef Developer Kit <https://docs.chef.io/install_dk.html>`__.  The |chef manage| has many features and is useful for viewing and creating policy to be applied to nodes, the |chef dk| installs a collection of tools---|kitchen|, |chef spec|, |chef ctl|, |chef vault|, |foodcritic|, and more---and libraries that are all packaged together, which makes it easier to manage the dependencies these tools may have on each other and the dependencies that |chef| has on |ruby|.
