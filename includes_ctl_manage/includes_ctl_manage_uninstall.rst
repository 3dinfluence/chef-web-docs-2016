The ``uninstall`` subcommand is used to manage the hooks between |runit| and ``sysvinit`` or ``upstart``. This subcommand does not `uninstall the Chef management console <http://docs.chef.io/uninstall.html#chef-manage-title>`__.

This subcommand has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ opscode-manage-ctl uninstall
