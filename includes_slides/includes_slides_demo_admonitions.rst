Notes and warnings! (Use sparingly.)

.. note:: This is a note. Use this as a visual separator to occasionally refer to something important. It's blue so it's less obvious on the page.

.. warning:: This is a warning! Use this as a visual separator to remind people when they might break something. Or maybe to say something pithy and true. It's bright yellow to ensure that everyone actually sees it.

Resist the urge to use them. They are more useful that way.
