.. The contents of this file are included in multiple slide decks.
.. This file should not be changed in a way that hinders its ability to appear in multiple slide decks.

There are three types of links:

* Hardcoded, i.e. http://ampledata.org/splunk_storm_chef_handler.html
* ```linkName <http://docs.chef.io/>`__``
* ``:doc:`pageTitle </filename>```

The hardcoded link is useful because viewers can write it down and/or print it out. The second one hides the actual URL and is good for inline linking in HTML files, which is good if the slides are available to everyone online. The third one probably isn't used too often, if at all. But in theory it will hyperlink to another slide in the slide deck.
