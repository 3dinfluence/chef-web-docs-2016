Sphinx is a document authoring platform that: 

* Uses a whitespace-delimited authoring format called reStructuredText (and is similar to Markdown)
* Uses the docutils parser/library---builds to HTML, PDF, man-page, reveal.js (slide decks), and other formats
* Is |python|-based---can be extended using the |python| platform
* Does more than render pages, it also tests the page and ensures valid content and structure
* Separates source (.rst files), structure ("map files"), and presentation (CSS, etc.)
* Enables content reuse across formats
