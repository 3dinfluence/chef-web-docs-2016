Sphinx is a document authoring platform that: 

* Uses a whitespace-delimited authoring format called reStructuredText that is similar to Markdown
* Uses the docutils parser/library---builds to HTML, PDF, man-page, revealjs, and other formats
* Is Python-based---can be extended using the Python platform
* Does more than render pages, it also tests the page and ensures valid content and structure
* Separates source (.rst files), structure ("map files"), and presentation (CSS, etc.)
* Enables content reuse across formats
