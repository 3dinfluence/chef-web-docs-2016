This is a table that is pulling in specific attributes/descriptions from |chef docs|:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 140 560
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Things
     - Description
   * - ``backup``
     - |backups_kept|
   * - ``manage_symlink_source``
     - |manage_symlink_source|
   * - ``sensitive``
     - |sensitive|

and so on. Is useful for ensuring that definitions are the same in training as in docs, but then also to help set the stage for deeper dives/examples in subsequent slides. TOTALLY OPTIONAL!
