|company_name| began as a consulting company named HJK Solutions, which built fully automated infrastructure for startups. |company_name| then changed its name to Opscode, which was a cool name for a while. But then interactions started going like this:

"So where do you work?"

"Opscode."

"What does Opscode do?"

"Devops software, infrastructure automation, you know..."

"Oh, you mean like Chef?"

"Yes, just like Chef."

Sometimes we felt like we were explaining "Why Opscode?" more than we wanted to. And then Opscode itself turned out to be a weak brand, easily confused and often misspelled:

So now we call ourselves what we should have called ourselves all along: |chef|. Everything else is still the same. Our software removes people from the process of building automated infrastructure, as much and as often as possible. |chef| is a system integrations framework built on top of a configuration management system. It's powered by |ruby| and by a simple DSL. |chef| is open source, with an outstanding community, and a license that allows everyone to safely integrate |chef| into their organization, and then extend it to match each organization's unique complexity, requirements, and scale.
