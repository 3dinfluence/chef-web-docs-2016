|chef open server| is an open source version of the |chef server| that contains much of the same functionality as |chef hosted|, but requires that each instance be configured and managed locally, including performing data migrations, applying updates to |chef open server|, and ensuring that the |chef open server| scales as the local infrastructure it is supporting grows. |chef open server| includes support from the |chef| community, but does not include support directly from |opscode|.
