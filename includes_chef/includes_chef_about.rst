|chef| is a thin DSL (domain-specific language) built on top of |ruby|. This approach allows |chef| to provide just enough abstraction to make reasoning about your infrastructure easy. |chef| includes a built-in taxonomy of all the basic resources one might configure on a system, plus a defined mechanism to extend that taxonomy using the full power of the |ruby| language. |ruby| was chosen because it provides the flexibility to use both the simple built-in taxonomy, as well being able to handle any customization path your organization requires.
