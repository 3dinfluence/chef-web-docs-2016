When the |chef client| configures each node in the system, the order in which that configuration occurs is very important. For example, if |apache| is not installed, then it cannot be configured and the daemon cannot be started. Configuration management tools have struggled with this problem for a long time. For each node a list of recipes is applied. Within a recipe, resources are applied in the order in which they are listed. At any point in a recipe other recipes may be included, which assures that all resources are applied. The |chef client| will never apply the same recipe twice. Dependencies are only applied at the recipe level (and never the resource level). This means that dependencies can be tracked between high-level concepts like "I need to install |apache| before I can start my |django| application!" It also means that given the same set of cookbooks, the |chef client| will always execute resources in the same exact order.
