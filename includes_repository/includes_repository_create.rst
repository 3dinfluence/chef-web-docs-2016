There are two ways to create a |chef repo| when using the |company_name| boilerplate repository as a base:

* Clone the |chef repo| from |github|
* Download the |chef repo| as a |tar gz| file and place it into local version source control.

.. note:: |company_name| strongly recommends using some type of version control tool to manage the source code in the |chef repo|. |company_name| uses |git| for everything, including for cookbooks. |git| and/or |github| is not required to use |chef|. If another version source control system is preferred over |git| (such as |svn|, |mercurial|, or |bazaar|) that is just fine.
