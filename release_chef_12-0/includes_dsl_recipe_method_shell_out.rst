The ``shell_out`` method can be used to run a command against the node, and then display the output to the console when the log level is set to ``debug``.

The syntax for the ``shell_out`` method is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   shell_out(*command_args)

where ``command_args`` is the command that is run against the node.
