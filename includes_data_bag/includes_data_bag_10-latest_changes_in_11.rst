In |chef client| 10, objects in encrypted data bag items are serialized to |yaml| before being encrypted. Unfortunately, discrepancies between |yaml| engines in different versions of |ruby| (in particular, 1.8.7 and 1.9.3) may cause silent corruption of serialized data when decrypting the data bag (the version stored on the |chef server| is untouched and can be correctly deserialized with the same |ruby| version that was used to create it, however).

Because the corruption is silent, there is no way for the |chef client| to detect it; furthermore, all workaround possibilities we've investigated have severe limitations. Additionally, we wanted to modify the encrypted data bag item format to support using a random initialization vector each time a value is encrypted, which provides protection against some forms of cryptanalysis. In order to solve these issues, we've implemented a new encrypted data bag item format:

* The user interface to encrypted data bags is unchanged. This change only affects the format of the encrypted values.
* |chef client| 11 clients will be able to read encrypted data bags created with either |chef client| 10 or |chef client| 11.
* |chef client| 10 clients (|chef client| 10-18 and higher) will be able to read encrypted data bags created with either |chef client| 10 or |chef client| 11
* |chef client| 10 clients version |chef client| 10-16 (and lower) cannot read encrypted data bags created with |chef client| 11
* |chef client| 11 knife commands will only create data bags in the new format.
* |chef client| 10 knife commands will only create data bags in the old format.
