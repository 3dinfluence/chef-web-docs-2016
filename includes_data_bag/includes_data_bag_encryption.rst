The contents of a data bag can be encrypted using `shared secret encryption <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm>`_. This allows a data bag to store confidential information (such as a database password) or to be managed in a source control system (without plain-text data appearing in revision history).
