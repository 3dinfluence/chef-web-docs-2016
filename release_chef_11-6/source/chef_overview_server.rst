About the Server
=====================================================

.. include:: ../../includes_chef_server/includes_chef_server.rst

There are three types of servers:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 420
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Server
     - Description
   * - Enterprise Chef
     - .. include:: ../../includes_chef/includes_chef_private.rst
   * - Hosted Enterprise Chef
     - .. include:: ../../includes_chef/includes_chef_hosted.rst
   * - Open Source Chef
     - .. include:: ../../includes_chef/includes_chef_open_source.rst

Components
=====================================================
.. include:: ../../includes_chef_server/includes_chef_server_component_erchef_background.rst

The following diagram shows the various components that are part of a |chef server| deployment and how they relate to one another.

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 420
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Component
     - Description
   * - Bookshelf
     - .. include:: ../../includes_chef_server/includes_chef_server_component_bookshelf.rst

       All cookbooks are stored in a dedicated repository.
   * - WebUI
     - .. include:: ../../includes_chef_server/includes_chef_server_component_webui.rst
   * - Erchef
     - .. include:: ../../includes_chef_server/includes_chef_server_component_erchef.rst
   * - Message Queues
     - Messages are sent to the Search Index using the following components:
       
          #. .. include:: ../../includes_chef_server/includes_chef_server_component_rabbitmq.rst
          #. .. include:: ../../includes_chef_server/includes_chef_server_component_expander.rst
          #. .. include:: ../../includes_chef_server/includes_chef_server_component_solr.rst

       All messages are added to a dedicated search index repository.
   * - Nginx
     - .. include:: ../../includes_chef_server/includes_chef_server_component_nginx.rst
   * - PostgreSQL
     - .. include:: ../../includes_chef_server/includes_chef_server_component_postgresql.rst

For |chef hosted|, these components are mostly transparent because of the hosted interface for the |chef server|. For |chef private| and the open source |chef server|, these relationships can be more complex, depending on how the machines on which the |chef server| will run need to be deployed. 

Common Features
=====================================================
Each type of |chef server| provides the following features:

.. list-table::
