The ``/search`` endpoint allows nodes, roles, data bags, environments to be searched. This endpoint has the following methods: ``GET``.

.. note:: At the end of every |chef client| run, the node object is saved to the |chef server|. From the |chef server|, each node object is then added to the |apache solr| search index. This process is asynchronous. By default, node objects are committed to the search index every 60 seconds or per 1000 node objects, whichever occurs first.
