The ``POST`` method is used to create an organization on the |chef server|.

This method has no parameters.

**Request**

.. code-block:: xml

   POST /organizations

with a request body that looks something like:

.. code-block:: javascript

   {
     "name": "chef",
     "full_name": "Chef Software, Inc.",
   }

where:

* ``name`` must begin with a lower-case letter or digit, may only contain lower-case letters, digits, hyphens, and underscores, and must be between 1 and 255 characters. For example: ``chef``.
* ``full_name`` must begin with a non-white space character and must be between 1 and 1023 characters. For example: ``Chef Software, Inc.``.

.. note:: An organization isn't usable until a user that belongs to the ``admins`` group is associated with the organization.

.. code-block:: javascript

   { "org_name"=>"https://url/for/org_name" }
