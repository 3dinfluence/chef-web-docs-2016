Release Notes: |chef server oec| 11.1.x
=====================================================

.. include:: ../../includes_chef/includes_chef_index_oec.rst

What's New
=====================================================
The following items are new for |chef server oec| 11.1.x and/or are changes from previous versions:

* **Support for IPv6** Support has been added to allow the |chef server oec| server and the |chef client| to run in an IPv6 infrastructure.
* **Lua / Redis-based API routing** The routing mechanisms used by the API proxy have been reworked. This allows for more dynamic and fine-tuned control over routing upstreams and feature flags.
* **Front-end certificate service** The certificate service for public and private key generation is moved to the front-end machines for non-standalone installations. This allows the certificate service to be scaled horizontally. 
* **Bookshelf hostname configuration** The host for the location in which cookbooks are stored---|service bookshelf|---is now configurable. Previous versions of |chef server oec| directed this traffic directly to the backend host:port of the |service bookshelf| service.
* **External Bookshelf traffic over HTTPS** |chef server oec| defaults to the host header that is set by the incoming HTTP request. This ensures that URLs generated by the |service bookshelf| service based on requests to the API front end will be directed back to that front end and will be correctly proxied to the back end service.
