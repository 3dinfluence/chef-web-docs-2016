If a project is a cookbook, we recommend that starting with ``delivery-truck``, an open source build cookbook created for driving cookbook pipelines in |chef delivery|. You can customize some aspects of ``delivery-truck`` through your project's ``.delivery/config.json``. To have more control or to opt-out of some of the behavior of ``delivery-truck``, create a wrapper build cookbook. To learn more about wrapper cookbooks, see `Chef Supermarket -> Wrapper Cookbooks <https://docs.chef.io/supermarket.html#wrapper-cookbooks>`_ and the blog post `Doing Wrapper Cookbooks Right <https://www.chef.io/blog/2013/12/03/doing-wrapper-cookbooks-right/>`_.
