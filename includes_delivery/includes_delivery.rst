Use |chef delivery| to continuously deliver applications and infrastructure safely:

* A tested and proven workflow that is already in use by organizations that have successfully adopted devops practices
* A visualization of the flow of changes that move through the development pipeline; immediately see how an idea is formed, built, and put into production
* View dependencies among interdependent projects and services; automatically test those dependencies every time a change occurs
* An automated software delivery pipeline that is built using the same configuration management system you are already using: |chef|!
