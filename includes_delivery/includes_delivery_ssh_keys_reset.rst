When provisioning for SSH delivery, the placement of the keys is crucial. If you should find yourself getting an error like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   Error executing action 'converge' on resource 'machine[chef-server-test3]'

   RuntimeError

   Machine chef-server-test3 ( on ssh:/home/mabrahms/delivery-cluster/.chef/provisioning/ssh)
   did not become ready within 120 seconds

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:

#. Verify that your SSH keys are the problem by attempting to log into your chef server over SSH.

   If you cannot do that, then your SSH keys need to be re-synced.

   If you can, then your SSH configuration may be wrong. In some environments the problem may be that the |chef delivery| server's SSH key has changed for the hostname or IP address your chef server uses. Local |vagrant| clusters see this when the |chef server| ``box`` file changes (or when switching between |vmware| and |virtualbox|) because the SSH key is generated during the OS install.

#. When the server SSH key â€‹is the problem, the fix is to delete the entry for that machine from ``$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts``.

#. To create an SSH key (without a passphrase):

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "you@example.com"

   The output is similar to:

   .. code-block:: bash

      Generating public/private rsa key pair.
      Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
      Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
      Enter same passphrase again:
      Your identification has been saved in /Users/path/to/.ssh/id_rsa.
      Your public key has been saved in /Users/path/to/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
      The key fingerprint is:
      ac:8a:57:90:58:c1:cd:34:32:18:9d:f3:79:60:f3:41 your_email@chef.io
      The key's randomart image is:
      +--[ RSA 4096]----+
      |  .==*o.E        |
      |  . *o*..        |
      |   o + = .       |
      |  . o o.o        |
      |     . ..S       |
      |      ..         |
      |     ..          |
      |   .*o*.         |
      |  ...            |
      +-----------------+

#. Now that you have a new public-private key pair, re-propagate the public key out to your Delivery cluster nodes using a method such as the one
described at the beginning of the **SSH Provisioning** section.
