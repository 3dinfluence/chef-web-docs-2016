You must authenticate access to the |chef delivery| Git server, which by default runs on port 8989. 

.. note:: This authentication step is for the Git server that comes with |chef delivery|. If you actually integrate with GitHub, as described below, you will not need to do this.

Run this SSH command; enter Yes when prompted.

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ ssh -l USER@ENTERPRISE -p 8989 DELIVERY_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS

You should get output similar to this:

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ ssh -l sally@chef -p 8989 10.194.11.99
